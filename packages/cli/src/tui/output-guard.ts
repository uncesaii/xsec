/**
 * Terminal output guard for the OpenTUI surface.
 *
 * The renderer owns every cell on screen and repaints differentially: it
 * tracks what it believes is already displayed and only emits the changed
 * cells. Any write that reaches the terminal from outside the renderer
 * (`process.stderr.write`, a stray `console.error`, a library banner)
 * scrolls or overprints the framebuffer without the renderer knowing, so
 * every subsequent frame is diffed against a model that no longer matches
 * reality. The visible result is ghost rows, fused text, and characters
 * from one widget appearing inside another.
 *
 * `@xsec/core` has 60+ such call sites (quota notices, retry warnings,
 * scanner diagnostics). Rewriting each one to thread a logger through is
 * both invasive and permanently fragile — a single new `console.warn` in
 * any dependency reintroduces the corruption. Instead the TUI claims the
 * process-level streams while it is mounted and turns anything written to
 * them into structured lines the UI can render inside the transcript.
 *
 * Ordering matters. OpenTUI saves the real `stdout.write` when the
 * renderer is constructed and emits frames through that saved reference,
 * so this guard MUST be installed *after* `createCliRenderer` — then the
 * renderer's own output bypasses it and only application writes are
 * captured. `restore()` is defensive: it reinstalls the originals only if
 * the live functions are still the ones it installed, so a renderer
 * teardown that resets the stream first is never undone.
 *
 * Nothing is discarded silently. Captured lines are buffered (bounded) and
 * delivered to `onLine`, because an operator running an authorized
 * engagement needs to see "plan quota exhausted" — dropping it to keep the
 * screen clean would trade one bug for a worse one.
