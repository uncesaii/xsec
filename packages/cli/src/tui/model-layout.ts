/**
 * Layout, navigation and windowing arithmetic for the full-screen model
 * picker.
 *
 * This is `settings-layout.ts` for `/model`, and it exists for the same reason
 * spelled out in `PRIMITIVES.md`: OpenTUI lays rows out with Yoga, and Yoga
 * *shrinks* siblings rather than clipping them. Two `<text>` nodes that
 * together want more cells than their row has are both painted in full into
 * boxes that are now too small, and the terminal shows the two strings
 * interleaved character by character — `runs12`, `target:cnone`. The same
 * failure on the vertical axis makes a bordered box paint its own bottom
 * border through its last content row. So the component reads widths and row
 * counts off a `ModelLayout` and never computes one, and a sweep hammers every
 * number in here across widths 0..200 and heights 0..80.
 *
 * ## Why the screen exists at all
 *
 * `/model` used to open a compact picker floating above the composer: a flat
 * list of 43 ids with a `provider · price` caption each. That shape has no
 * room for the one thing an operator actually needs before switching model,
 * which is whether this machine holds credentials for the vendor at all. A
 * turn started against a dark provider dies with zero tokens and a message
 * about a key nobody knew they needed.
 *
 * ## The accuracy rule this module is built around
 *
 * Credential state is reported **per provider**, never per model.
 *
 * A previous attempt annotated each row "no credentials" using the provider
 * that `model-catalog.ts` carries. That was wrong and was reverted. The
 * catalogue's provider comes from the pricing table (`modelProvider`, a
 * prefix match on the id), while the runtime resolves a model's provider
 * through its own detection and failover order — `providerForModel` in
 * `packages/core/src/runtime/llm-api.ts`, which core does not export. Those
 * two disagree in practice: an OpenAI-named model can in fact be served by the
 * ChatGPT/Codex backend, so a per-row verdict flags working models as broken,
 * which is the worst possible failure for a screen whose whole selling point
 * is telling the truth about reachability.
 *
 * What is verifiable from here is which *providers* hold credentials in the
 * environment, and that is all this module claims: a state on each provider
 * heading, the full env-var and setup detail in the detail pane, and — when
 * the highlighted model's nominal provider is dark while some other provider
 * is lit — a line naming the lit ones, so the operator can judge. There is no
 * "you cannot use this model" anywhere, by design.
 *
 * ## Reuse
 *
 * `shellChromeRows` and `wrapCells` are imported from `settings-layout.ts`
 * rather than copied. `shellChromeRows` in particular is the *corrected*
 * mirror of `run.tsx`'s `getShellChromeHeight`: the original assumes a
 * one-row footer, but `FooterBar` stacks to three rows below 64 content
 * cells, and a screen that fills its column — as this one does — overflows by
 * two rows on every narrow terminal if it believes the original. Neither
 * helper is settings-specific; the honest long-term home for both is a shared
 * `shell-geometry.ts`, and this import is the marker for that move.

 * What can be said about a provider without lying.

 * - `ready`   — an env var listed in `PROVIDERS` holds a credential.

 *               the environment authenticates it. Note that `providerStates`
 *               never stats the filesystem, so a provider with a `fileSource`
 *               can read `missing` here while the runtime still finds an
 *               on-disk token; the detail pane says so rather than pretending.
 * - `unmapped` — the pricing table names a vendor the runtime has no direct
 *               env path for at all (`google`, `meta`, `mistral`, `unknown`).
 *               These are reachable, if at all, through an aggregator such as
 *               OpenRouter, which is a routing question this module cannot
 *               answer.
