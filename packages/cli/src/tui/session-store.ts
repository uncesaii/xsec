/**
 * Console session transcripts, persisted to `~/.xsec/console-sessions/<id>.json`.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS WRITES TO DISK, AND WHY IT IS SENSITIVE
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This store persists the *entire* native message array of a console session:
 * every operator prompt, every model reply, and every tool call together with
 * its full result. On a security tool that is engagement content, not chat
 * history. In practice a single file here can contain:
 *
 *   - target hostnames, IPs, internal URLs and the scope an operator approved;
 *   - discovered findings before they are triaged, redacted or disclosed;
 *   - raw HTTP requests and responses captured as exploit evidence, including
 *     session cookies, bearer tokens and CSRF tokens seen on the wire;
 *   - file contents and command output from the operator's own machine;
 *   - credentials the operator pasted into the console, or that a tool echoed.
 *
 * It is written because operators want to close the console and pick the
 * engagement back up — `ConsoleSession` already accepts `initialMessages`, so
 * restoring a session is exactly "hand back the array we stored". The cost of
 * that convenience is a durable, plaintext copy of the above sitting in the
 * operator's home directory, which is a fact both they and any future
 * maintainer of this file need to hold in mind.
 *
 * The transcript is stored FAITHFULLY. This module deliberately does not
 * attempt to scrub secrets out of it, and that is a decision, not an omission.
 * A scrubber over free-form tool output cannot be complete — it would catch
 * `Authorization: Bearer …` and miss the same token inside a JSON body, a
 * base64 blob, a JWT in a URL, or a password in a stack trace — and a partial
 * scrub is worse than none: it advertises a guarantee it cannot keep, so the
 * file gets treated as safe to copy into a ticket, a bug report or a shared
 * host. It would also corrupt the very evidence a resumed session needs. So
 * the contract is the honest one: everything is kept, nothing is sanitised,
 * and the protection is filesystem permissions plus the operator's ability to
 * delete.
 *
 * Consequences, enforced here rather than left to callers:
 *
 *   1. Files are 0600 and the directory is 0700, re-applied on every save so
 *      an entry left loose by an older build, a restored backup or a hand-edit
 *      is tightened rather than trusted.
 *   2. Nothing is transmitted anywhere. This is local disk only — no upload,
 *      no telemetry, no cloud sync path.
 *   3. Deletion is first-class: `deleteSession` removes one transcript and
 *      `pruneSessions` caps how much history accumulates, so the store does
 *      not silently retain an operator's engagements forever.
 *   4. Nothing here prints, on any path. This runs inside a TUI that owns the
 *      terminal, and the payloads involved are exactly the ones that must not
 *      reach a scrollback buffer or a CI log.
 *
 * Like the settings and credential stores next door, every function is TOTAL:
 * a missing directory, an unreadable file, malformed JSON or a read-only home
 * is reported as an empty/false/null result, never as an exception. A bad
 * history file may not take down a live console.
