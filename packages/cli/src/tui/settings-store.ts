/**
 * A live, process-wide store for the interactive console's display settings.
 *
 * The problem it solves: every TUI screen used to read settings with
 * `useState(() => loadSettings())` — a snapshot frozen at mount. A change made
 * in the settings screen only reached another screen when that screen was
 * unmounted and remounted, which is both a lie (the change was "saved" but the
 * chat kept its stale copy) and a bug waiting to surface the moment chat stops
 * being torn down on navigation. This module is the single source of truth:
 * the settings screen writes it, and every screen subscribes to it, so a
 * change re-renders every consumer synchronously with no remount.
 *
 * It owns no persistence or validation of its own. `settings.ts` already holds
 * the total `normalizeSettings`, the never-throwing layered `loadSettings`, and
 * the report-by-return-value `saveSettings`; this is a thin, subscribable cache
 * in front of them. Two contracts inherited from that module carry through here:
 * nothing throws on an I/O failure (a read-only `$HOME` is an inconvenience,
 * not a lost session), and a failed save still takes effect in memory so the
 * UI reflects the operator's choice — it just reports `false`.
 *
 * ── Two-level configuration ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Reads resolve the GLOBAL file (`~/.xsec/tui-settings.json`) with a per-project
 * OVERRIDE (`<cwd>/.xsec/tui-settings.json`) layered on top, per key, falling
 * through to the built-in defaults. This happens automatically on the load path
 * (`getSettings`/`reloadSettings`) — no bootstrap wiring is needed anywhere.
 *
 * Writes target a LAYER. `updateSetting` writes to the PROJECT file when a
 * project override file already exists, or when the caller passes
 * `scope: "project"`; otherwise it writes the GLOBAL file. `setSettings` (the
 * whole-object write the settings screen uses) always writes the global base.
 * The provenance of every effective value is exposed via `getSettingSources` so
 * `xsec config show` can label each key default/global/project.
