/**
 * Selectable colour themes for the interactive console.
 *
 * The console's palette used to be twelve loose `export const` hex strings in
 * `ui/theme.ts`, imported directly by `chat-screen.tsx` and `run.tsx`. That
 * shape has exactly one palette in it: there is nowhere to put a second set of
 * values, and nowhere to assert anything about the first set. The result was a
 * console that is unreadable on a light terminal, that renders `ERROR` at
 * 3.77:1 on its own panels, and that signals tool success and tool failure with
 * two colours a deuteranope cannot tell apart by hue.
 *
 * So the palette becomes a *table* — `THEMES` — keyed by name, with the token
 * set expressed as a type so a new token cannot be added to one theme and
 * forgotten in the other three. Everything else here exists to make that table
 * checkable rather than decorative:
 *
 *   - `contrastRatio` / `relativeLuminance` are the WCAG 2.2 definitions, so
 *     "is this readable" is arithmetic a test can run, not a judgement call.
 *   - `validateTheme` runs the completeness and contrast checks over any
 *     candidate palette, including one a user might supply later.
 *   - `CONTRAST_WAIVERS` enumerates — with measured ratios — the places the
 *     default palette knowingly fails AA. They are recorded, not hidden: the
 *     test asserts the measured ratio still matches the recorded one, so
 *     changing the default palette fails loudly in either direction.
 *
 * Two constraints drove the palette design and are worth stating up front.
 *
 * First, semantic colour must survive colour blindness. `SUCCESS`, `WARNING`
 * and `ERROR` mark tool outcomes; red/green at equal luminance is a blank to
 * roughly 8% of men. Every theme therefore separates the three by *luminance*
 * as well as hue — see `MIN_SEMANTIC_CONTRAST`.
 *
 * Second, a truecolor hex is a lie on a 16-colour terminal. `detectColorDepth`
 * and `degradePalette` handle that honestly and narrowly; read the "Terminal
 * capability" section of `THEMES.md` for exactly what they do and do not do.
 *
 * The colour/validation core of this module is pure: no I/O, no React, no
 * process access; the one function that reads the environment takes it as an
 * argument. The single exception is the clearly-fenced "Installed themes"
 * section at the foot of the file, which reads validated theme palettes off disk
 * (`~/.xsec/themes/`). That I/O is total and fail-soft — an unreadable dir or a
 * corrupt file is skipped, never thrown — so it cannot take a session down, and
 * the pure functions above it never call into it.
