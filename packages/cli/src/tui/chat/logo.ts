 * strokes. "SEC" stays white. This grid is the fixed base the
 * intro animation reveals: `computeLogoFrame` (logo-animation.ts) turns it into
 * a per-cell frame and `logoRowRuns` coalesces each row into same-tone runs the
 * render draws as explicitly-sized `<text>`s (widths sum to exactly
 * `TERMINAL_BLOCK_LOGO_WIDTH`), which keeps a row's segments from overflowing.

 * The colourful intro styles (rainbow, matrix, wave, neon, and the comet
 * gradients of shimmer/fade/strike/draw) can't be expressed in the five named
 * tones, so `logo-animation.ts` computes an explicit `#rrggbb` and carries it in
 * the `tone` field itself (it stays pure — no theme). Any value starting with
 * `#` is passed straight through as the foreground; everything else is a named
 * tone mapped to a theme token here. A hidden cell renders as spaces (the caller
 * picks the glyph), so this is only consulted for visible runs; the fg is
 * harmless on a space run regardless.
