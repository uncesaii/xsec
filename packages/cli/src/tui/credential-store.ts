/**
 * Per-provider LLM credentials, persisted to `~/.xsec/credentials.json`.
 *
 * The runtime resolves provider credentials from environment variables only
 * (see `provider-status.ts`, transcribed from `llm-api.ts`). That is fine for
 * a shell with the right exports and hostile to everyone else: an operator who
 * has not exported the variable gets a turn that dies with zero tokens, and
 * the fix — an export that survives the next terminal — lives outside the
 * tool. This module is the durable side of that. The console can write a key
 * here once; `credentialEnvPatch` turns the file back into the env additions
 * the runtime already knows how to read, so nothing downstream has to learn a
 * second credential source.
 *
 * `PROVIDERS` is imported, never re-derived. Several providers deviate from
 * the `<VENDOR>_API_KEY` pattern and one is OAuth rather than an API key; a
 * second copy of that table here would drift from the runtime silently, which
 * for credentials means writing a secret into a variable nobody reads.
 *
 * This file holds secrets, so three rules are absolute and each is enforced
 * below rather than left to callers:
 *
 *   1. On-disk artefacts are owner-only — 0600 for the file, 0700 for the
 *      directory — and are re-tightened on every save, not just at creation.
 *   2. An explicit shell export always beats the file. The store is a
 *      convenience for the unconfigured case; it may never quietly shadow a
 *      credential the operator chose in their environment.
 *   3. Nothing here prints. Not to stdout, not to stderr, not on an error
 *      path — this runs inside a TUI that owns the terminal, and the values
 *      involved are exactly the ones that must never reach a scrollback
 *      buffer or a CI log. `redactSecret` exists so display code has a safe
 *      option; the raw values leave this module only through the env patch.
 *
 * Like the settings store next door, I/O failure is reported as a return
 * value: a read-only `$HOME` is an inconvenience, not a reason to lose the
 * console.

/**
 * The environment additions implied by the store — the bridge between a file

 * Precedence is the whole point: a variable already carrying a credential in
 * `env` is never touched. An `export` in the current shell is an explicit,
 * deliberate act, and a stored key silently overriding it would make "which
 * key did that run use?" unanswerable — exactly the question you need answered
 * when a request 401s or when a metered key racks up spend. An exported-but-
 * empty variable is treated as absent, matching `provider-status.ts`: it is a
 * broken export, not a choice.
 *
 * The check spans *all* of a provider's variables, not just the one we would
 * write. A parent process that supplied `XSEC_CHATGPT_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN`
 * already configured that provider; injecting a stored access token alongside
 * it would mix credentials from two sources into one auth attempt, and the
 * runtime prefers ours — which is precisely the silent override this rule forbids.
 *
 * When we do fill, we fill `envVars[0]`: that list is ordered by the runtime's
 * own preference, so the first entry is the variable it actually reads first.
 *
 * Pure over its arguments — no `process.env` read, no mutation of either input.
 * Callers merge the result themselves and can therefore preview a patch, log
 * its *keys*, or apply it to a child process rather than this one.
