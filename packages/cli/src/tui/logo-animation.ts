/**
 * Pure, deterministic per-frame animation for the "xsec" block-logo intro.
 *
 * This module owns only the *logic* of the intro: given the base logo grid
 * (the three-letter colour map used by the masthead — `' '` empty, `'#'` white,
 * `'/'` red), an animation style, and a frame index, it returns the per-cell
 * render state for that frame. It renders nothing, imports no theme, reads no
 * clock — `computeLogoFrame(grid, style, frame)` is a pure function of its
 * inputs, so every frame is unit-testable in isolation.
 *
 * The caller (the masthead) drives it with a frame ticker and maps each cell's
 * `tone` to a theme token and `visible`/tone to `TextAttributes.DIM`:
 *
 *   tone "text"  -> theme.TEXT   (full)
 *   tone "error" -> theme.ERROR  (full, the red slash)
 *   tone "dim"   -> theme.TEXT (or a dim token) + TextAttributes.DIM
 *   tone "muted" -> theme.MUTED  (the mid/highlight tone; DIM optional)
 *   tone "brand" -> theme.BRAND  (the purple accent — a bright leading edge or
 *                                 pulse peak)
 *   tone "#rrggbb" -> that literal colour as the foreground (see COLOUR below)
 *   visible:false -> render a single space (the cell is not yet drawn)
 *
 * COLOUR CONTRACT. The flashy styles (rainbow, matrix-rain, wave, neon, and the
 * comet gradients of shimmer/fade/strike/draw) need arbitrary per-cell colour,
 * not just the five named tones. Rather than smuggle a second field through the
 * render (the masthead paints one coalesced run at a time and reads only
 * `run.tone`), a cell's `tone` may itself BE an explicit `#rrggbb` hex string.
 * `logoRunStyle` (chat/logo.ts) recognises a leading `#` and passes it straight
 * through as the foreground; every other value is one of the named tones it maps
 * to a theme token. This module stays pure — it computes the hex (see
 * `hslToHex`/`greyHex`) and never imports a theme; the theme mapping lives in the
 * caller. A hex tone is transient: no colourful style carries one into its final
 * frame, so `finalLogoFrame` (the `off`/`reduceMotion`/settled mark) is always
 * the mono/red-slash resting frame with only named tones.
 *
 * Because the caller renders cell-by-cell from this state, the row widths are
 * preserved verbatim (every row is padded to the grid's max width), so no
 * `fitTuiText` pass is needed and the OpenTUI row-overflow invariant holds.
 */

/**
 * Intro styles, matching settings.ts `logoAnimation`.
 *
 * One-shot reveals play once and settle to `finalLogoFrame`:
 *   - `glitch`  a deterministic scramble (now with neon flashes) that resolves
 *               cell by cell — the DEFAULT.
 *   - `matrix`  a matrix-rain reveal: staggered RED drops fall column by
 *               column, each leaving the settled mark behind it.
 *   - `wave`    a rippling RED wavefront (a sine-bent edge) wipes the mark in.
 *   - `neon`    a neon-sign warm-up: cells buzz on in neon colours, then settle.
 *   - `strike`  a red slash strikes the X along its diagonal (bright-red hot edge).
 *   - `draw`    a left-to-right column reveal behind a bright pen tip.
 *   - `fade`    a centre-out brightness bloom (a red-tinted multi-step ramp).
 *   - `typein`  per-cell reveal in reading order with a bright-red leading glow.
 *   - `sweep`   a bright bar wipes L→R revealing the mark behind it.
 * Looping idle effects run forever (the caller wraps the frame modulo the count):
 *   - `rainbow` a hue sweep cycling the spectrum across the mark, forever.
 *   - `shimmer` a bright comet (a multi-step grey gradient tail) sweeps across.
 *   - `pulse`   the red slash breathes dim→red→bright red.
 * `off` is the static settled mark.
