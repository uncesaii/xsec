/**
 * Diagnostic loader for user-supplied themes.
 *
 * A user drops theme JSON files into their per-user themes directory
 * (`~/.xsec/themes/<id>.json` — the same dir `themes.ts` calls "installed
 * themes"; this module is the human-facing view over it). Each file is a
 * palette (a token->hex map under `palette`) plus optional display metadata.
 *
 * `themes.ts` already reads that directory into a resolvable cache, but it does
 * so *fail-soft and silent*: a malformed or low-contrast file is simply skipped,
 * with no way to tell the user *why* their theme did not show up. This module
 * fills that gap with a PURE loader that, given a directory, returns both the
 * valid `ThemeEntry`s AND a `rejected` list carrying a clear, specific reason
 * per bad file — so `theme list`/settings can explain "your `neon.json` was
 * rejected: ERROR on CANVAS is 2.1:1, below 4.5:1" instead of silently dropping
 * it.
 *
 * It is the single source of truth for what a valid user theme is: `themes.ts`
 * builds its resolvable cache from THIS loader's `valid` list (see
 * `readInstalledThemes`), so a theme that resolves is exactly a theme this
 * loader accepts, and one this loader rejects never becomes selectable. That is
 * how the invariant "never apply an invalid/low-contrast theme" is upheld: the
 * validation gate is here, ahead of resolution.
 *
 * Purity: the loader takes the directory as an argument and does no other I/O;
 * it consults no clock and no RNG, so the same directory contents always yield
 * the same result (valid entries are returned sorted by name). The only side
 * effect is reading the files it is pointed at, which is inherent to a loader.
