/**
 * The single source of truth for every keyboard shortcut the chat console
 * (`chat-screen.tsx`) binds.
 *
 * This module is PURE DATA — no React, no OpenTUI, no `@xsec/core` — so it can
 * be imported by the reference view, the settings surface, and a future
 * remapping layer alike, and unit-tested without a terminal.
 *
 * ## Accuracy rule
 *
 * Nothing here is invented. Every entry was read off a real `useKeyboard`
 * branch in `chat-screen.tsx`, and each carries a `handler` field quoting the
 * guard it was captured from so the registry can be re-verified against the
 * code. When a single action is reachable by more than one chord (the palette
 * on Ctrl+P *or* Ctrl+K, scrolling on PageUp *or* Ctrl+Up), the alternates are
 * shown together in one `keys` string rather than split into look-alike rows.
 *
 * Modal overlays (the command/theme/model picker, the approval and
 * `ask_operator` cards, the secret-entry prompt) reuse Up/Down to move,
 * Enter to confirm and Esc to cancel — the same keys documented here for the
 * base composer, given a modal meaning while the overlay is up. They are not
 * repeated as separate entries; the descriptions below name those meanings.
 *
 * ## Intended future: live remapping (out of scope here)
 *
 * This registry is deliberately the *only* place the full binding set is
 * enumerated, so that a later phase can hang key remapping off it: a persisted
 * overrides store keyed by {@link Keybinding.id}, an edit UI that writes it, and
 * a lookup that `chat-screen.tsx`'s handlers consult instead of their current
 * hard-coded `key.name === …` guards. Today those guards are still the runtime
 * authority and this module only DESCRIBES them — keep the two in sync until the
 * handlers are migrated to read from here. See the task's "phase-2" note.
