/**
 * Data model for the single-line TUI status bar.
 *
 * The bar we are reproducing looks like this:
 *
 *     GPT-5.6-Terra · max   ~/coding/xsec-labs/xsec   publish/main-integration *54 ?29   1.4%/1M  (sub)
 *
 * Everything here is pure: segments in, string out. The renderer owns the
 * colours, the grouping and the cell allocation, because those are the parts
 * that depend on OpenTUI. Keeping the *content* decisions on this side means
 * the two rules that actually matter — "never invent a number" and "never
 * claim more columns than the terminal has" — are unit tests rather than
 * something to eyeball in a screenshot.
 *
 * Two of those rules are worth stating outright:
 *
 *  - A context percentage is only shown when the caller supplied both the
 *    window size and the tokens currently held in it. A status bar that
 *    guesses a context figure is worse than one that shows nothing: the
 *    number is used to decide when to compact a session, so a fabricated
 *    one costs the user real work.
 *  - The returned line is *always* within the given width, including the
 *    degenerate case where a single segment is wider than the terminal. A
 *    row that overflows in OpenTUI does not clip, it overprints its
 *    siblings (see chat-layout.ts), so "too long" is a corruption bug and
 *    not a cosmetic one.
