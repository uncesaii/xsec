/**
 * Git context for the TUI status bar.
 *
 * The status bar mirrors the compact prompt other tools show — branch name
 * plus a count of modified and untracked files, e.g.
 *
 *     ~/coding/xsec-labs/xsec   publish/main-integration *54 ?29
 *
 * Two constraints shape this module. First, the numbers must come from git
 * itself, not a hand-rolled directory walk, because git already knows the
 * ignore rules, the index state, and submodule boundaries — reimplementing
 * that would drift from what the user sees in `git status`. Second, the read
 * happens on the render path of a live terminal UI, so it must be both fast
 * and unable to fail: a status bar that throws, hangs, or prints to the
 * terminal it does not own is worse than one that simply shows nothing.
 *
 * The porcelain v2 format (`git status --porcelain=v2 --branch`) is the
 * stable, machine-readable contract for exactly this — it is documented to
 * remain compatible across git versions, unlike the human-facing output.
 * Parsing lives in `parseGitStatus`, kept pure so the tests can exercise
 * every branch/upstream/change permutation from string fixtures without a
 * real repository. `readGitStatus` is the thin, failure-swallowing shell
 * that actually invokes git.
