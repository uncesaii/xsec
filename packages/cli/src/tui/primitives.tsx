/**
 * Overflow-proof layout primitives for the TUI.
 *
 * ## The bug this file exists to delete
 *
 * OpenTUI lays rows out with Yoga, and Yoga does not clip. A row of
 * auto-width `<text>` siblings that collectively want more cells than the
 * row has is *shrunk*, not truncated — every sibling keeps painting its
 * full string into a box that is now too small, so the strings are drawn
 * on top of one another. That is where these came from:
 *
 *   "Show available slash commands"  ->  "Showpavailableenslash commands"
 *   "xsec / chat" + "target: none"   ->  "target:cnone"
 *   "runs" + "12"                    ->  "runs12"
 *
 * The same thing happens on the vertical axis: a bordered box squeezed
 * below its content height still paints its own bottom border, straight
 * through the last rows of its content — `-/clear--------/new-`.
 *
 * And there is a third, sneakier variant. `fitTuiText` routes through
 * `sanitizeTuiText`, which collapses whitespace *and trims*. So
 * `fitTuiText("runs ", 8)` is `"runs"`, not `"runs "` — a padded literal
 * used as a separator silently disappears and the label fuses to its
 * value even when the row had room to spare.
 *
 * ## The fix
 *
 * The existing cure is a convention: give every sibling an explicit
 * `width`, add `flexShrink={0}`, budget the string with `fitTuiText`
 * against that same width, use a real `gap` rather than a padded literal,
 * and hand-check that widths plus gaps never exceed the container. That
 * convention has been broken dozens of times because nothing enforces it.
 *
 * These primitives enforce it structurally:
 *
 *   - `Cells` cannot be constructed without a width, always sets
 *     `flexShrink={0}`, and always routes its text through `fitTuiText`
 *     against that exact width. There is no way to put unbounded text
 *     through it: its children are typed `string | number`, not
 *     `ReactNode`, so an unbudgeted `<text>` cannot be nested inside.
 *   - `Columns` takes the available width and a list of *intents*
 *     (`{ fixed }`, `{ flex }`, `{ content }`) and does the arithmetic
 *     itself. It has no `children` prop, so a stray auto-width sibling
 *     cannot be smuggled into the row.
 *   - `LabelValue` separates its two halves with a real `gap`, so the
 *     trimming trap above cannot occur.
 *   - `Rows` takes a `fitRows` result and renders with an explicit
 *     `height` and `flexShrink={0}`, so a border can never be pushed
 *     through its own content.
 *
 * The allocation math is pure and exported separately from the components
 * (`allocateColumns`, `allocateLabelValue`, `fitRows`), following the
 * precedent set by `chat-layout.ts`, so the invariant
 *
 *     sum(widths) + gap * (renderedColumns - 1) <= available
 *
 * is a unit test rather than a code review.
