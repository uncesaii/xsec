/**
 * Which LLM providers this machine can actually reach.
 *
 * The `/model` picker is derived from the pricing table, which lists every
 * model the tool knows how to price — not every model it can currently call.
 * An operator can therefore pick a model whose provider has no credentials
 * here; the turn then dies with zero tokens and a message about a key they
 * never knew they needed. This module is the truthful side of that: it names
 * the providers the runtime can detect, the exact env vars each one reads,
 * and how to configure the ones that are dark.
 *
 * The mapping below is transcribed from the provider detection in
 * packages/core/src/runtime/llm-api.ts — `resolveFailoverProvider`
 * (~L660-712), `providerForModel` (~L1152-1200), and the env-priority chain
 * in `detectProvider` (~L1386-1533). It is DERIVED, not guessed: several
 * providers deviate from the `<VENDOR>_API_KEY` pattern (`Z_AI_API_KEY`,
 * `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, and the two `XSEC_CHATGPT_*` tokens), so extend
 * this table by re-reading that file rather than by analogy.
