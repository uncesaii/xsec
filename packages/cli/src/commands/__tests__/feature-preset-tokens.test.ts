/**
 * Anti-drift pin between the CLI's preset-token set and core's resolver.
 *
 * `scan.ts` recognises preset tokens from a local literal so it does not have
 * to import core just to parse `--features`. That duplication is safe only if
 * both sides agree, and the failure mode if they don't is silent: an
 * unrecognised token becomes a meaningless `XSEC_FEATURE_*` var and enables
 * nothing, while the run still succeeds and reports findings. This test makes
 * that divergence loud.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT mock `@xsec/core` — the point is to check the CLI
 * against the real resolver.
