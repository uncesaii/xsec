/**
 * Pure formatter for the core's `cross_validated_leads` bus event (xsec
 * FoxGuard cross-validation, Phase 4). The event is emitted once per scan when
 * the multi-modal agreement layer ran and at least one finding reached
 * `both_fire` — i.e. both the xsec agent AND the foxguard pattern scanner
 * fired on the same file. See `CrossValidatedLeadsPayload` in
 * `@xsec/core` (`packages/core/src/events/bus.ts`).
 *
 * This module is intentionally PURE and presentation-agnostic: it validates a
 * (possibly malformed) payload, orders + caps the leads, and returns plain
 * text lines. The scan command (`run.ts`) applies chalk coloring and printing.
 * Keeping it pure lets it be unit-tested without stdout/TTY plumbing and keeps
 * the fail-soft parsing in one place (a bad payload must never crash a scan).
