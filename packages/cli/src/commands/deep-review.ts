/**
 * `xsec deep-review <target>` — the SEEDLESS depth-review scan (G-A).
 *
 * This is the "depth method" (PR #1162: specialized finder lenses × best-of-N +
 * the multi-lens verify quorum) exposed as a dispatchable, seedless product.
 * Unlike `xsec hunt` (which REQUIRES a `--seed` fix diff to derive variant
 * candidate sites), deep-review needs no seed: it enumerates candidate files
 * straight from the prepared source tree and re-hunts each through the profile's
 * `*FinderLenses`, gating survivors through the profile's `*VerifyLenses`
 * multi-lens refute quorum.
 *
 *   prepare(target) ─▶ enumerate candidate files (scope-capped, subsystem-scoped)
 *                          │
 *                          ▼
 *     runHuntScan({ candidates, lenses: <p>FinderLenses,
 *                   verify: makeMultiLensVerifier(<p>VerifyLenses) })
 *                          │  confirmed leads
 *                          ▼
 *     leadToCandidateFinding ─▶ CloudSink (same 'discovered' candidate path as hunt)
 *
 * A deep-review finding is a LEAD, not a confirmed bug: the multi-lens quorum
 * filters (each lens re-reads and refutes) but does not PROVE. In cloud mode the
 * leads flow to the orchestrator as `discovered` candidates and enter the
 * cloud's own adversarial verify gate, exactly like `hunt`.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 → the sweep RAN to completion — a VALID outcome whether or not any lead
 *       survived the quorum. A clean 0-lead hunt is a success, not a failure
 *       (the cloud worker maps a non-zero CLI exit to scan status=failed, so a
 *       completed 0-finding sweep must exit 0 or it is wrongly marked failed —
 *       the CapyFi/Onyx "failed with 0 findings" incident, 2026-07-08).
 *   2 → skipped (no candidate files, or the scope exceeds the review cap)
 *   3 → error (bad flags, unreadable target, or the sweep did NO work at all —
 *       every finder errored/timed out, i.e. an LLM/backend failure)
