/**
 * Bridge between the interactive console's operator gates and the herdr
 * pane-state sink.
 *
 * herdr distinguishes `working` from `blocked`, and `blocked` is the state
 * that actually earns its keep: it is what drives the "this agent needs
 * you" attention queue, the sidebar highlight and the toast. xsec's event
 * bus has no event meaning "waiting on the operator" — the scope-approval
 * and co-pilot gates resolve their promises inline and emit nothing — so
 * the signal has to come from the surface that owns the prompt.
 *
 * The sink instance is created once at CLI bootstrap and parked here so the
 * TUI can reach it without threading a core object through every screen.
 * Everything is a no-op when xsec is not running inside herdr.
