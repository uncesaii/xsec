/**
 * Anthropic prompt-caching (`cache_control`) breakpoint placement.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The native agent loop re-sends the ENTIRE conversation on every turn — that
 * is how a stateless Messages API works. Without caching, turn N re-bills and
 * re-processes the system prompt, every tool schema, and all N-1 prior turns
 * at full input price. That is what produced the latency curve quoted in
 * `agent-runner.ts` (5s at turn 1 → 60s at turn 14) and the turn-budget
 * amputation that followed from it. Prompt caching is the direct fix: mark the
 * stable prefix once and every later turn reads it at ~0.1x price and a
 * fraction of the prefill latency.
 *
 * WIRE CONTRACT (Anthropic Messages API)
 * --------------------------------------
 * This engine speaks the raw `/v1/messages` wire (there is no `@anthropic-ai/sdk`
 * dependency in this workspace), so the constants below encode the documented
 * API contract rather than an SDK type:
 *
 *   - `cache_control: { type: "ephemeral" }` attaches to a CONTENT BLOCK, not to
 *     the request. Valid on tool definitions, `system` text blocks, and message
 *     content blocks (`text` / `tool_use` / `tool_result` / `image` / `document`).
 *   - At most FOUR breakpoints per request. A fifth is a request error, so the
 *     budget below is a hard cap, not a tuning knob.
 *   - Render order is `tools` → `system` → `messages`. A breakpoint on the last
 *     `system` block therefore covers the tool schemas too — they sit earlier in
 *     the same prefix — which is why we spend ONE breakpoint, not two, on the
 *     whole static header.
 *   - Caching is a strict PREFIX match: one changed byte anywhere before a
 *     breakpoint invalidates that breakpoint and every later one.
 *   - Each breakpoint looks back at most TWENTY content blocks to find an
 *     existing cache entry. A turn that appends more than 20 blocks therefore
 *     strands the previous entry unless an intermediate breakpoint bridges the
 *     gap — see `planMessageBreakpoints`.
 *   - Below the model's minimum cacheable prefix (512–4096 tokens depending on
 *     model) a breakpoint is silently ignored: no cache entry, no error. Marking
 *     a short prompt is therefore harmless, which is why placement here is
 *     unconditional rather than gated on an estimated token count.
 *
 * RELATIONSHIP TO COMPACTION
 * --------------------------
 * `native-loop.ts` compacts history at `COMPACTION_THRESHOLD` by REWRITING the
 * message array (middle turns collapse into one summary message). That mutates
 * the cached prefix, so it necessarily invalidates every message-level cache
 * entry — no placement strategy can avoid that, it is inherent to rewriting
 * history. What we can control is recovery, and the design here handles it
 * structurally: breakpoints are recomputed from the CURRENT array on every
 * single call and never persisted across turns. The first post-compaction call
 * therefore re-establishes a fresh set of breakpoints over the rewritten
 * transcript and pays one cache write; turn N+1 reads it again. The system
 * breakpoint is unaffected either way — compaction never touches `system` or
 * the tool schemas, so the largest static block keeps hitting straight through
 * a compaction event.

/**
 * Target spacing between consecutive ROLLING message breakpoints, in content
 * blocks.
 *
 * What this buys, concretely. Breakpoints are placed relative to the tail, so
 * on turn N+1 each new breakpoint must land within `CACHE_LOOKBACK_BLOCKS` of
 * an entry written on turn N. If a turn appends G blocks (a turn firing many
 * parallel tools appends one block per `tool_use` plus one per `tool_result`,
 * so G can be large), the new tail breakpoint is G blocks past the old tail
 * entry — it misses outright once G > 20. The second rolling breakpoint sits
 * `BREAKPOINT_SPACING_BLOCKS` further back, so its distance to that same old
 * entry is |G − 15|, which stays inside the window for G up to ~35.
 *
 * So: two rolling breakpoints at this spacing keep the cache warm across turns
 * appending up to roughly 35 content blocks, versus 20 for a lone tail
 * breakpoint. They cost nothing on small turns — the spacing test simply never
 * fires and no extra marker is emitted.
 *
 * Note this reasoning covers the rolling breakpoints only. The head anchor is
 * pinned to message 0, so its entry is re-found at distance zero on every turn
 * regardless of spacing; it is deliberately not part of this chain.

 *
 * Allocation, in priority order:
 *
 *  1. **The tail** (always). The newest message is where the conversation's
 *     growing edge is; marking it writes a cache entry covering everything
 *     said so far, which the NEXT turn reads back. This is the breakpoint that
 *     actually converts an O(turns²) re-prefill into an O(turns) one.
 *  2. **Spaced bridges**, walking backwards while budget remains, placed
 *     whenever `BREAKPOINT_SPACING_BLOCKS` blocks have accumulated since the
 *     last pick. These exist purely to defeat the 20-block lookback limit: on a
 *     turn that appends a large parallel-tool batch, the tail breakpoint alone
 *     could not see the previous entry, and every hit would be lost exactly
 *     when the conversation is largest. They cost nothing when turns are small
 *     — the spacing test simply never fires, and no breakpoint is emitted.
 *  3. **The head anchor** (message 0), if budget is left over. Message 0 is the
 *     task prompt: the largest, oldest, most stable message, and the one
 *     `compactMessagesWithLLM` preserves verbatim. Anchoring it means even a
 *     compaction or a TTL expiry of the rolling entries still leaves a warm
 *     prefix to read from.
