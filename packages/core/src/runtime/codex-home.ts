/**
 * Run-scoped `CODEX_HOME` for agent runs whose working directory is code we
 * just downloaded.
 *
 * ## The problem
 *
 * The package-audit pipeline installs an arbitrary third-party package into
 * `$TMPDIR/xsec-audit-<uuid>` (`package-ecosystems.ts`) and then runs the
 * analysis agent with `cwd` set to `<tempDir>/node_modules/<pkg>`
 * (`agent-runner.ts` → `runtime/process.ts`, which spawns `codex exec`). The
 * Codex CLI records a trust decision for whatever directory it runs in, into
 * the operator's own `~/.codex/config.toml`:
 *
 *     [projects."/private/var/folders/…/xsec-audit-8103b3c8/node_modules/lodash"]
 *     trust_level = "trusted"
 *
 * Sixteen such entries were found on the dev host — one per audited package.
 *
 * Trust is not cosmetic. It gates project-local `.codex/config.toml`, hooks,
 * exec policies and MCP server definitions. A hostile package that ships
 * `node_modules/<pkg>/.codex/config.toml` with a hook gets execution, and the
 * host runs `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"`, so there is no OS sandbox
 * underneath. Codex's AGENTS.md discovery walks project-root→cwd, which is
 * normally why a buried AGENTS.md never loads — but this pipeline puts cwd
 * *inside* the dependency tree, which is exactly the case that does load.
 *
 * ## The fix
 *
 * Give that subprocess its own throwaway `CODEX_HOME`, seeded with the
 * operator's provider configuration but no trust entries, and delete it when
 * the run ends. Any trust decision, project-local config or hook the run picks
 * up dies with the directory.
 *
 * ## What crosses the boundary
 *
 * IN: `config.toml` with every `[projects.…]` section stripped, and
 * `auth.json` verbatim (the run has to be able to authenticate).
 *
 * OUT: `auth.json` ONLY, and only when it changed and still parses as
 * credentials. Codex rotates the OAuth refresh token on use and invalidates
 * the old one, so discarding a rotated token would silently break the
 * operator's interactive login. Nothing else comes back — not trust, not
 * config, not hooks, not history. Copy-back is not a new exposure: a run that
 * reached code execution under `danger-full-access` could already write the
 * real `~/.codex/auth.json` directly.
 *
 * Note this covers the `codex` SUBPROCESS only. `llm-api.ts` resolves its own
 * credentials from `homedir()` (`readChatGptCodexAuthFile`) and `$HOME`
 * (`parseCodexAzureConfig`), never from `CODEX_HOME`, so setting it here
 * cannot break the in-process API path — and those readers never write, so
 * they are not a persistence vector.
