/**
 * protocol/http-conformance.ts — the minimal Tier-1 conformance flow that wires
 * the three building blocks of issue #972's foundational slice into one pass:
 *
 *   conformance-gen (LLM infer→validate→repair)  →  ranked DivergenceHypotheses
 *        → for each, craft + SEND the exercise via the existing http_request
 *          tool (the only protocol driver that exists today, `recon.ts`)
 *        → oracle-http (deterministic) verdicts
 *        → return CONFIRMED divergences as hypothesis Findings, using the same
 *          confidence/promotion contract as `review.ts` / `kernel-verify.ts`.
 *
 * Reuse, don't reinvent:
 *   - The Finding emitted on confirm mirrors `incompleteFixLeadToFinding`
 *     (`kernel/incomplete-fix-hunt.ts:206`) and the kernel promotion contract
 *     (`verify/kernel-verify.ts:1108` `applyVerificationToFinding`): a CONFIRMED
 *     divergence is `status: "confirmed", confidence: 1.0`; an unconfirmed
 *     hypothesis stays low-confidence and is NOT emitted as a finding here.
 *   - The HTTP send is injectable (an {@link HttpSender}) exactly like
 *     kernel-verify takes an injectable `runner`/`agentInvoker`: the real
 *     `http_request` tool handler lives on the heavyweight `ToolExecutor`
 *     (scope/rate-limit/attribution context), so callers pass a thin adapter
 *     over it and tests pass a deterministic mock — no live network in tests.
 *
 * This is a FUNCTION, not a new global tool — it does NOT touch
 * `agent/tools.ts` or `agentic-scanner.ts`.
