/**
 * Inbound prompt-injection defense for untrusted tool output (#558).
 *
 * Our agents ingest attacker-controlled target output — HTTP response bodies,
 * crawled HTML/PDF, file contents, MCP tool outputs — straight back into the
 * model context. A malicious target can embed instructions in that content
 * ("indirect" / embedded prompt injection) to steer OUR harness: fabricate a
 * `save_finding`, exfiltrate a token, ignore the operator's task, etc. We
 * already detect this class when the *target* is under test
 * (`mcp.ts` `SUSPICIOUS_TOOL_OUTPUT`), but did nothing when our own loop is the
 * victim — risky given the documented agent-fabrication history that
 * `findings-parser.ts:validateFileRef` already pushes back on for file paths.
 *
 * This module is the generic, tool-result-content analogue of that
 * anti-fabrication instinct. It is deliberately:
 *
 *   - Deterministic / pattern-based. No LLM-guards-LLM design (a second model
 *     is itself injectable, and HiddenLayer's rule is that detectors must sit
 *     OUTSIDE the protected model). Pure regex + structural wrapping.
 *   - Non-destructive. We NEUTRALIZE markers (escape / annotate) rather than
 *     silently drop content, because the same bytes are usually legitimate task
 *     data (a crawled page genuinely containing the words "ignore previous…").
 *     Dropping them would blind the agent; annotating them defangs the
 *     imperative while preserving the evidence.
 *   - Scoped. Applied ONLY to results from untrusted-source tools
 *     (http_request / crawl / read_file / send_prompt / submit_form / MCP).
 *     Our own structured outputs (save_finding, query_findings, done, …) are
 *     never touched — see `isUntrustedSourceTool`.
 *
 * The wrapper marks the enclosed bytes as DATA, not instructions, with an
 * explicit system-level note, so even un-neutralized residue is framed
 * correctly to the model.
