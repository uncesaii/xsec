/**
 * Solidity/EVM static-analysis SEED layer for the `evm-onchain` review profile
 * ("0contract").
 *
 * Fallback layer for when the configured static scanner does not return
 * Solidity leads (Semgrep's Solidity coverage is thin and Slither is not on
 * PATH in the engine image). This gives the review concrete seeds (file:line +
 * rule + snippet + why) to hunt from, in the exact `SemgrepFinding` shape the
 * review prompt already consumes (`evmOnchainReviewAgentPrompt`).
 *
 * MVP SCOPE (honest): this is a ripgrep/regex seed layer. It is a LEAD
 * generator, not a verifier — every seed is "this token appears here, look at
 * it", and the review agent still does the reachability + guard-present +
 * value-impact analysis the profile mandates. Regex cannot prove a
 * `.call{value:}` is re-enterable or that a price read is manipulable; it can
 * only point the agent at the candidate sink. A `slither --json` pass is a
 * deliberate FOLLOW-UP (needs solc + the Slither toolchain in the sandbox,
 * which isn't present today). The regex layer ships now and needs only
 * ripgrep, which the engine already depends on.
 *
 * The bug classes mirror the `evm-onchain` profile's "Hypothesis classes"
 * section, so the seeds and the prompt speak the same language.
