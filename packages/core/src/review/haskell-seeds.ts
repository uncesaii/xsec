/**
 * Haskell static-analysis SEED layer for the `cardano-haskell` review profile.
 *
 * Fallback layer for when the configured static scanner does not return
 * Foxguard's built-in Cardano Haskell leads. This gives the review concrete
 * seeds (file:line + rule + snippet + why) to hunt from, in the exact
 * `SemgrepFinding` shape the review prompt already consumes
 * (`cardanoHaskellReviewAgentPrompt`).
 *
 * MVP SCOPE (honest): this is a ripgrep/regex seed layer. It is a LEAD
 * generator, not a verifier — every seed is "this token appears here, look at
 * it", and the review agent still does the reachability + total-function +
 * already-caught analysis the profile mandates. Regex cannot prove a `head` is
 * reachable from untrusted input; it can only point the agent at the call site.
 * `hlint --json` integration (and a Stan pass) is a deliberate FOLLOW-UP — both
 * need a Haskell toolchain in the sandbox that is not present today (`hlint` is
 * not on PATH in the engine image). The regex layer ships now and needs only
 * ripgrep, which the engine already depends on.
 *
 * The bug classes mirror the `cardano-haskell` profile's "Hypothesis classes"
 * section, so the seeds and the prompt speak the same language.
