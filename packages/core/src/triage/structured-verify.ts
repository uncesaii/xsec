- Check for WAF or input-validation middleware that strips SQL metacharacters.
- String concatenation into a query is necessary but not sufficient — the parameter must be reachable.`,
    payload_validation: `SQL Injection payload checks:
- Does the payload match the target database dialect?
- UNION SELECT: does the column count match the original query?
- Boolean-based: do true/false responses actually differ?
- Time-based: is the delay reliably above network jitter (>2s)?
- Error-based: does the error message come from the DB engine or the app framework?
- Check that the response contains DB-sourced data, not just a reflected string.`,
    impact_assessment: `SQL Injection impact assessment:
- Read-only (SELECT) vs write (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) vs admin (DROP, FILE, LOAD_FILE).
- Can the attacker extract credentials, PII, or secrets?
- Is stacked-query execution possible (enables arbitrary commands on MSSQL/PostgreSQL)?
- Does the DB user have FILE or DBA privileges?
- Can the injection be escalated to OS command execution (xp_cmdshell, COPY TO PROGRAM, INTO OUTFILE)?`,
    exploit_confirmation: `SQL Injection reproduction:
- Replay the exact payload. Check for data leakage in the response body.
- For blind SQLi, use time-based confirmation: response time delta > 2 seconds.
- For UNION-based, verify returned data is from a different table than the legitimate query.
- Confirm the response is not a generic error page or WAF block page.`,

    reachability: `XSS specifics:
- Trace the user input to the HTML output context (attribute, tag body, script block, URL).
- Check for output encoding: HTML entity encoding, JavaScript escaping, URL encoding.
- Check for Content-Security-Policy headers that would block inline script execution.
- Check if the framework auto-escapes (React, Angular, Vue with v-text, Django templates).
- DOM-based XSS: trace from source (location.hash, document.referrer) to sink (innerHTML, eval, document.write).`,
    payload_validation: `XSS payload checks:
- Does the payload break out of its injection context (attribute, tag, script)?
- Is the payload actually reflected/stored and rendered in HTML?
- Check that the response Content-Type is text/html (not application/json or text/plain).
- For stored XSS: verify the payload persists and renders on subsequent page loads.
- Look for actual script execution evidence: alert(), confirm(), or DOM modification — not just reflection.
- Browser-based validation is strongest: does the dialog actually fire?`,
    impact_assessment: `XSS impact assessment:
- Reflected vs Stored vs DOM-based — stored is highest impact.
- Is the affected page authenticated? Can session cookies be stolen (check HttpOnly flag)?
- Can the XSS reach admin pages or perform privilege escalation via CSRF?
- Is there a Content-Security-Policy that limits exploitability?
- Self-XSS (requires victim to paste payload) is typically not a real vulnerability.`,
    exploit_confirmation: `XSS reproduction:
- Navigate to the URL with the payload. Confirm script execution via dialog or DOM change.
- For stored XSS: submit the payload, then visit the page as a different user.
- The gold standard is an alert/confirm/prompt dialog firing in a headless browser.
- Check that the payload is not neutered by encoding in the rendered HTML source.`,

- Check if the input goes through a template or is just string concatenation (not SSTI).
- Autoescaping in the template engine does NOT prevent SSTI — it only prevents XSS.`,

- Does {{7*7}} or ${"`${7*7}`"} return 49 in the response?
- Is the math result from the template engine or from JavaScript on the client side?

- Read IDOR (viewing other users' data) vs Write IDOR (modifying other users' data) vs Delete IDOR.
- What data is exposed? PII, financial records, admin settings, or non-sensitive preferences?
- Can the IDOR be used for mass data extraction (enumerable IDs)?
- Is the IDOR on an admin endpoint (vertical privilege escalation)?`,

- Authenticate as user A. Request user B's resource by changing the ID.
- Verify the response contains user B's data, not user A's or a generic error.

- Identify the HTTP client library — some block private IPs by default.
- Check if redirects are followed (open redirect chaining).`,
    payload_validation: `SSRF payload checks:
- Does the server make a request to the attacker-controlled or internal URL?
- For blind SSRF: register an OAST handle with the \`oast_register\` tool, inject its http_url/dns_host as the SSRF target, then \`oast_poll\` — a token-matched DNS/HTTP callback is concrete proof (xsec#659). Fall back to an external collaborator (Burp, webhook.site) only if OAST is not deployed.
- For internal SSRF: does the response contain internal service data (169.254.169.254, localhost)?
- Check that the response is from the internal service, not an error page or WAF block.
- DNS resolution must happen server-side, not client-side.`,
    impact_assessment: `SSRF impact assessment:
- Blind SSRF (can reach internal hosts) vs Full SSRF (response returned to attacker).
- Can cloud metadata be accessed (AWS IMDSv1 at 169.254.169.254)?
- Can internal services be port-scanned or interacted with?
- Can the SSRF be escalated to RCE via internal service exploitation?
- Protocol-specific impacts: gopher://, file://, dict:// may enable additional attacks.`,
    exploit_confirmation: `SSRF reproduction:
- Send the request with an internal URL target. Verify the response contains internal data.
- For blind SSRF: confirm out-of-band interaction (DNS lookup or HTTP callback).

- Trace from user input to the system call (exec, spawn, popen, system, backticks).

- Check if the application uses array-form exec (safe) vs string-form (vulnerable).
- Check for chroot, containers, or AppArmor that limit command execution impact.`,
    payload_validation: `Command Injection payload checks:
- Does the response contain command output (uid=, whoami, file contents)?
- Check for time-based confirmation: ;sleep 5 with >5s response delay.
- Verify the output is from the injected command, not from application logic.
- Out-of-band: DNS lookup or HTTP callback to confirm blind command injection.
- The payload must use the correct separator for the OS (; for Unix, & for Windows).`,
    impact_assessment: `Command Injection impact assessment:
- Command injection is almost always critical severity — it provides RCE.
- What user does the application run as? Root/admin escalates the impact.
- Can the attacker read sensitive files, install persistence, or pivot?
- Is the container/sandbox restrictive enough to limit blast radius?
- Network access from the compromised host: can it reach internal services?`,
    exploit_confirmation: `Command Injection reproduction:
- Execute a benign command (id, whoami, hostname) and verify output in the response.
- If blind: use time-based or out-of-band detection.
- Confirm the command runs server-side, not client-side (JavaScript eval is not command injection).
- Verify that shell metacharacters are interpreted, not escaped in the output.`,

  file_upload: {
    reachability: `File Upload specifics:
- Trace from the multipart upload to the file storage location.
- Check for extension validation (allowlist vs blocklist), MIME type checking, and magic byte validation.
- Determine if uploaded files are served with executable content types.
- Check if the upload directory has execution permissions (web-accessible + server-side execution).
- Check for filename sanitization (path traversal via ../ in filename).`,

- Was the malicious file actually uploaded and stored?
- Can the file be accessed via a predictable URL?
- Does the server execute the file (PHP, JSP, ASP) or serve it as static content?
- For web shell uploads: does accessing the uploaded file execute server-side code?
- Check that the "success" response isn't just a 200 OK with no actual file storage.`,
    impact_assessment: `File Upload impact assessment:
- Web shell upload = RCE = critical severity.
- Stored XSS via HTML/SVG upload = high severity.
- File overwrite via path traversal in filename = high severity.
- ZIP bomb or resource exhaustion = DoS = medium severity.
- Unrestricted upload of non-executable files = low/info.`,
    exploit_confirmation: `File Upload reproduction:
- Upload the malicious file. Determine its storage URL.
- Access the file via HTTP and confirm server-side execution (command output in response).
- For XSS via upload: access the file in a browser and confirm script execution.
- Verify the file persists and is accessible across sessions.`,

- Identify the serialization format: Java ObjectInputStream, PHP unserialize, Python pickle, Ruby Marshal, .NET BinaryFormatter, JSON with type hints.
- Trace from user input to the deserialization call.
- Check for type allowlists or deserialization filters (Java ObjectInputFilter).
- Identify available gadget chains in the classpath/dependencies.
- Check if the input is actually deserialized or just parsed as structured data (JSON.parse is not unsafe deserialization).`,
    payload_validation: `Deserialization payload checks:
- Does the payload use a valid gadget chain for the target runtime?
- Is the serialized object format correct (magic bytes, version headers)?
- For Java: does the classpath contain Commons Collections, Spring, or other gadget libraries?
- For PHP: does the application have __wakeup/__destruct methods that chain to dangerous operations?
- Check that the "exploitation evidence" shows actual code execution, not just a parsing error.`,
    impact_assessment: `Deserialization impact assessment:
- Unsafe deserialization with gadget chains typically leads to RCE = critical.
- Without known gadgets: may still cause DoS or information disclosure.
- Check the runtime environment: what can the exploited process access?
- Java deserialization with Commons Collections = well-known critical path.
- PHP unserialize without dangerous magic methods may be low impact.`,
    exploit_confirmation: `Deserialization reproduction:
- Send the serialized payload. Confirm code execution via command output or out-of-band callback.
- For blind exploitation: use DNS or HTTP callbacks to confirm execution.
- Verify the gadget chain is compatible with the target's dependency versions.
- The response must show evidence of the gadget chain triggering, not just the payload being accepted.`,
  },
  auth_bypass: {
    reachability: `Auth Bypass specifics:
- Identify the authentication mechanism: session cookies, JWT, API keys, OAuth, basic auth.
- Determine what is being bypassed: authentication (who are you?) or authorization (are you allowed?).
- Check for default credentials, hardcoded tokens, or debug backdoors.
- For JWT: check for algorithm confusion (none, HS256 vs RS256), weak secrets, missing validation.
- Check if the bypass works consistently or is a race condition.`,
    payload_validation: `Auth Bypass payload checks:
- Does the request without valid credentials return protected data?
- Compare authenticated vs unauthenticated responses — is the data actually different?
- For JWT bypass: does the modified token grant access to protected endpoints?
- For default credentials: confirm they work AND that they were not intended to be public.
- A login page returning 200 is not an auth bypass — check the response body for actual access.`,
    impact_assessment: `Auth Bypass impact assessment:
- Full authentication bypass (access any account) = critical.
- Privilege escalation (user to admin) = critical/high.
- Accessing a single unprotected endpoint with non-sensitive data = low.
- Default credentials on a demo/test deployment = medium (context-dependent).
- Session fixation or token leakage = high.`,
    exploit_confirmation: `Auth Bypass reproduction:
- Access a protected resource without valid authentication. Confirm the response contains protected data.
- For privilege escalation: authenticate as a low-privilege user and access admin resources.

## Your Task

Trace the data flow from external input to the vulnerability sink:

1. Identify the ENTRY POINT: where does attacker-controlled data enter the application?
   - HTTP parameter (query string, POST body, header, cookie)
   - File upload content
   - WebSocket message
   - URL path segment

2. Trace EVERY intermediate step between input and sink:
   - Is the input parsed, decoded, or transformed?
   - Does it pass through middleware, validators, or sanitizers?
   - Are there conditional branches that could prevent reaching the sink?

3. Identify the SINK: the dangerous operation where the vulnerability manifests.
   - Database query, command execution, template rendering, file operation, HTTP request, etc.

4. Determine: Can a malicious input ACTUALLY reach the sink in an exploitable form?
   - Is the code path reachable in normal application flow?
   - Are there guards that would block or neutralize the payload?
   - Does the application framework provide automatic protections?

## Target

${target}

## Your Task

Analyze the PoC request and response pair:

1. PAYLOAD CORRECTNESS
   - Is the payload syntactically correct for the claimed vulnerability type?
   - Does it target the right injection context (HTML attribute vs tag body, SQL string vs numeric)?
   - Is it using the right dialect/syntax for the target technology?

2. RESPONSE ANALYSIS
   - Does the response actually show evidence of exploitation?
   - Distinguish between: payload reflection (not necessarily vuln), error messages (may indicate vuln),
     actual data extraction (confirmed vuln), behavioral change (confirmed vuln).
   - Check for false indicators: generic error pages, WAF blocks, application-level rejections.

3. EVIDENCE STRENGTH
   - Strong: response contains data that could only come from exploitation (DB records, file contents, command output).
   - Medium: response shows behavioral difference (timing, error type, status code) consistent with the vulnerability.
   - Weak: payload is reflected in the response but no exploitation evidence.
   - None: response shows no indication of vulnerability (blocked, sanitized, or irrelevant).

4. COMMON FALSE POSITIVE PATTERNS
   - Payload reflected but HTML-encoded (not XSS).
   - SQL error message but from input validation, not actual SQL execution.
   - 500 error from malformed input, not from successful exploitation.
   - SSRF request succeeds but targets a public URL (not internal).
   - "Admin" data returned but the endpoint is intentionally public.

${finding.evidence.analysis ? `Analysis:\n${finding.evidence.analysis}\n` : ""}

## Target

${target}

## Your Task

Assess the actual security impact:

1. IMPACT CLASSIFICATION
   Determine which category applies:
   - Remote Code Execution (RCE): attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
   - Data Modification: attacker can alter data they should not have access to.
   - Information Disclosure: attacker can read sensitive data (PII, credentials, secrets).
   - Authentication/Authorization Bypass: attacker can access functionality without proper auth.
   - Denial of Service (DoS): attacker can make the service unavailable.
   - Client-Side Attack: attacker can execute code in other users' browsers (XSS).

2. SEVERITY VALIDATION
   Does the claimed severity match the actual impact?
   - Critical: RCE, full auth bypass, mass data breach, complete system compromise.
   - High: significant data access, privilege escalation, stored XSS on sensitive pages.
   - Medium: limited data exposure, reflected XSS, CSRF, information disclosure of non-secrets.
   - Low: minor info disclosure, self-XSS, missing security headers, theoretical attacks.
   - Info: best-practice violations with no direct security impact.

3. EXPLOITABILITY FACTORS
   - Does the attack require authentication? Special privileges?
   - Does it require user interaction (clicking a link, visiting a page)?
   - Is it reproducible or timing-dependent?
   - How complex is the attack chain?

4. SCOPE
   - Is the vulnerability limited to one user or does it affect all users?
   - Can it be used for lateral movement or escalation?
   - Does it expose infrastructure-level access (cloud metadata, internal services)?

{
  "passed": true/false,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,

## Claimed Severity: ${finding.severity}

You do NOT have access to the original finding description or the researcher's analysis.

## Your Task

1. UNDERSTAND THE CLAIM
   - Based solely on the request and response, what vulnerability is being claimed?
   - What would a successful exploit look like for this type of vulnerability?

2. ANALYZE THE EVIDENCE
   - Does the request contain a recognizable attack payload?
   - Does the response show genuine exploitation indicators?
   - Could the response be explained by normal application behavior?

3. REPRODUCTION FEASIBILITY
   - If you were to replay this exact request against the target, would you expect the same result?
   - Are there timing, session, or state dependencies that could affect reproduction?
   - Is the PoC self-contained or does it depend on prior setup steps?

4. INDEPENDENT VERDICT
   - Based ONLY on the evidence provided, is this a real, exploitable vulnerability?
   - Would this pass review by a senior security engineer?
   - Is there any indication of fabricated or misleading evidence?

${addendum}

## Common Red Flags for Fabricated Findings
- Response body that looks auto-generated or templated rather than from a real server.
- Exploitation evidence that is too clean or too perfectly matches the claim.
- Missing HTTP headers that would normally be present in a real response.
- Response timing or size that doesn't match the claimed behavior.
- PoC that only works with very specific, unlikely preconditions.
