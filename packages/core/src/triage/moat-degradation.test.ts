/**
 * Degradation tests for the opt-in FP-moat layers.
 *
 * These pin the safety property that the default-ON/KEEP-OFF assessment rests
 * on: when a moat layer's external dependency is missing — no foxguard binary,
 * no source tree, an unreadable path — the layer must return a NEUTRAL result
 * and never a suppression. A moat layer that rejects findings because a tool
 * was not installed would silently destroy recall on exactly the hosts least
 * likely to notice.
 *
 * They are also the precondition for enabling anything by default. A layer
 * cannot be a safe default until its absent-dependency path is proven inert,
 * so these tests are the evidence any future flip must cite.
 *
 * Note the asymmetry these encode: degrading safely is necessary but NOT
 * sufficient for a default flip. Both layers below also carry a per-finding
 * cost (a full repo walk / a full repo scan, neither cached across findings),
 * which is why they remain opt-in despite passing here.
