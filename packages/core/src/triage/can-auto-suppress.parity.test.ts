// #650 — cross-workspace parity guard for the disclosure-worthiness severity/
// class guard.
//
// The xsec engine and the xcloud orchestrator are decoupled by design (linked
// only by the cloud-sink wire format), and the engine is a separate publishable
// workspace that cannot import a private `@xcloud/*` package. So the engine
// keeps its own copy of this guard (`can-auto-suppress.ts`) and xcloud keeps the
// single source in `@xcloud/cloud-contracts` `disclosure-worthiness.ts`.
//
// The CANONICAL_* tables below are duplicated VERBATIM from that package's
// `disclosure-worthiness.test.ts`. Each side asserts its own exported sets
// against this identical table, so any divergence between the engine guard and
// the xcloud single source is caught here — without a physical cross-workspace
// import. PARITY: when you change a list, update BOTH this fixture and the
// xcloud one (and both source modules).
