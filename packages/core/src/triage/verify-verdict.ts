/**
 * The verify funnel — one verdict contract + one disclosure predicate.
 *
 * Verification in xsec happens on two separate scan loops that stay separate
 * by design (different domains):
 *   - the agentic/web path (`agentic-scanner.ts` → structured verify +
 *     self-consistency, then `runNativeVerify`), and
 *   - the static/code path (`unified-pipeline.ts` → `blindVerifyPrompt`).
 *
 * They used to converge nowhere: each emitted its own ad-hoc result shape and
 * each decided keep-vs-drop with hand-placed guard logic (or none at all). This
 * module is the single point of convergence at the RESULT level:
 *
 *   1. {@link VerifyVerdict} — the one verdict contract both paths emit.
 *   2. {@link isDisclosureWorthy} — the one predicate that owns keep/drop,
 *      delegating the severity/class guard to {@link canAutoSuppressDetailed}.
 *
 * The two scan loops still run independently; only their *verdicts* are unified.
 *
 * SINGLE SOURCE / PARITY (#650): the xcloud orchestrator keeps the same
 * predicate in `@xcloud/cloud-contracts` `disclosure-worthiness.ts` (the engine
 * and orchestrator are decoupled — neither can import the other's package). This
 * module is the engine's authoritative copy; the guard data is parity-checked in
 * `can-auto-suppress.parity.test.ts`. Keep the two `isDisclosureWorthy`
 * implementations behaviour-compatible.

 * `evidenceKind === "reproduced-poc"` — "there's something in the source" is
 * never enough. `source-only` confirmations stay held (needs_verify), never
 * silently dropped (#518).
 *
 * SINGLE SOURCE / PARITY (#650): the xcloud side keeps the same union in
 * `@xcloud/cloud-contracts` (`VerifyEvidenceKind`, PR #681). The engine and

 * parity-checked in `verify-evidence-kind.parity.test.ts` against the locked

 * has a value to assert, mirroring the `AUTO_SUPPRESS_*` arrays in
 * `can-auto-suppress.ts`.

 * NOTE: this tuple is the xcloud-PARITY-LOCKED set — it is asserted verbatim in
 * `verify-evidence-kind.parity.test.ts` against the cloud-contracts table. Do
 * NOT add a kind here until the SAME string has been added to the cloud-contracts
 * `VERIFY_EVIDENCE_KINDS` table in the same coordinated change (#701), or the
 * parity check asserts against a table the cloud side does not actually carry.
 * Engine-only kinds the cloud side does not yet derive stage in
 * {@link VERIFY_EVIDENCE_KINDS_ENGINE_EXT} until they graduate here, and are
 * folded into the {@link VerifyEvidenceKind} union below.
 *
 * `reproduced-memcorruption-poc` graduated from the engine-ext set into this
 * parity-locked tuple in the coordinated change of #701 (adopted by cloud-
 * contracts in lockstep): a PoC actually fired under the sanitizer / Miri build —
 * a real {@link CrashArtifact} reproduced (ASan/UBSan/MSan/Miri), not just a
 * static or source signal. It is the memory-safety analogue of `reproduced-poc`,
 * kept as a distinct string so the disclosure/telemetry layers can tell a
 * sanitizer-reproduced crash apart from a web/static PoC.
