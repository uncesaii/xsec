/**
 * Routing Feature Extractor
 *
 * Thin wrapper over `extractFeatures` from the existing
 * `triage/feature-extractor.ts`. The router consumes the same 45-feature
 * (well, 55 — 45 web + 10 kernel — but the issue and the paper refer to
 * it as "the 45-feature vector") handcrafted vector that the joint paper
 * (xsec#67) and the trained classifier (xsec#113) both train on.
 *
 * We deliberately DO NOT redesign or extend that vector inside the router
 * — it's the contract with the joint paper. Instead this module adds a
 * small set of **routing-specific scalars** (subsystem, prior layer
 * agreement) that the v0 rule-based router uses but the trained
 * classifier ignores. Those scalars live alongside the vector, not
 * inside it.
 *
 * See xsec#113 §"What the router sees".
