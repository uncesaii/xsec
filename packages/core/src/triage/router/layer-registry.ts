/**
 * Triage Layer Registry — catalog of the triage layers the router can
 * dispatch to. Each entry is **documentation in code**: the router uses the
 * `id` to refer to a layer, the runtime uses `env_flag` to read the existing
 * scan-level toggle, and the cost_factor is a normalized 0..1 estimate used
 * by the v0 rule-based router to prefer cheap layers over expensive ones.
 *
 * Cost factors are relative, not absolute USD: 0 = pure regex/grep (no LLM,
 * no network), 1 = full LLM-driven verify with tool use. The numbers come
 * from the per-layer telemetry shipped in xsec#112 and the per-layer
 * ablation in xsec#72's 2026-04-11 comment. They will be replaced by
 * measured medians once #112's telemetry has accumulated enough samples.
 *
 * See xsec#113 for the design doc, xsec#67 for the joint-paper plan.
