/**
 * Dynamic Triage Router — v0 rule-based, with a seam for a learned
 * classifier landing in a follow-up PR (xsec#113 phase 2).
 *
 * The router decides **per finding** which subset of the triage
 * layers to invoke. v0 ships explicit decision rules encoded from the
 * xsec#72 (2026-04-11) per-profile ablation comment; a later PR will
 * swap in a learned classifier (XGBoost or VulnBERT-style hybrid head)
 * trained on the per-layer telemetry shipped in xsec#112 and the
 * triage dataset described in xsec#67.
 *
 * The dispatch site (`agentic-scanner.ts`) treats the router as a
 * black-box `RouterModel`. To swap in a learned model later, ship a
 * new class implementing `RouterModel` and pass it to
 * `setRouterModel()` — no changes needed at the call sites.
 *
 * NOTE on rule (3) — "auto-reject on FP-pattern match":
 *   The token-overlap heuristic that ships in `triage/memories.ts` is
 *   intentionally coarse. A single fuzzy match dropping a real finding
 *   is the regression mode we worry about. v0 only triggers the auto-
 *   reject branch when the match score is **strong** (>= 0.85) AND the
 *   category matches exactly AND the agent's confidence is low (< 0.6).
 *   The threshold is conservative on purpose; promote it down only after
 *   measured A/B testing on the npm-bench slice.
 *
 * See xsec#113 design doc, xsec#72 ablation, xsec#67 paper plan.
