/**
 * Publishability triage layer (issue #537 / #539).
 *
 * "Reproduces" ≠ "in scope." This layer decides disclosure-worthiness so we
 * stop filing by-design / duplicate / dead-code / already-fixed findings. Each
 * check below maps to a *real* burn from a single triage session:
 *
 *   - threat-model → `by_design`   — webpack proto-pollution rejected by the
 *     maintainer ("don't run webpack on untrusted config — it's in our
 *     SECURITY.md"). Also nunjucks / eta / jsonata (template + expr evaluators).
 *   - dedup        → `duplicate`   — formidable (GHSA-3pj2-wmw4-qpcx), QEMU
 *     virtio-snd (CVE-2026-3196): an advisory already covers the class AND
 *     latest is patched.
 *   - dedup        → `fix_bypass`  — unzipper / mathjs / pug: an advisory
 *     exists, BUT our PoC still reproduces on the LATEST published version.
 *     This is the valuable exception and must NOT be dropped as a duplicate.
 *   - latest-ver   → `fixed`       — vm2 / adm-zip: the bug was fixed upstream;
 *     we reproduced on an old found-version, not the latest.
 *   - reachability → `unreachable` — node-forge form.js: the sink is only
 *     reachable from dead / unexported (non-public-API) code.
 *
 * Output: a {@link PublishabilityResult} with one of the
 * {@link PublishabilityDecision} verdicts. `in_scope` and `fix_bypass` are the
 * "green to file" verdicts; everything else is a reason to hold or drop.
 *
 * NETWORK SEAMS. The threat-model check needs the target's SECURITY.md and the
 * dedup check needs the global advisory DB (GHSA/OSV/CVE). Both are injected as
 * async functions on {@link PublishabilityInputs} so unit tests are
 * deterministic and offline — the layer itself performs no network I/O.
 *
 * GUARDRAIL. This module only *computes* a verdict. It never drops a finding.
 * The scanner wiring (`agentic-scanner.ts`) routes any suppression decision
 * through `canAutoSuppress`, so a high-severity / high-impact finding is
 * downgraded to `needs_verify` + human review, never silently dropped.
