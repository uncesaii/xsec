/**
 * Triage provenance — "which FP-moat layers actually ran for this finding?"
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * `finding.layerVerdicts` (xsec#112) is an append-only log that each triage
 * layer writes to as it executes. It is the only per-finding record of what
 * the triage stack did. But until now it had **no reader outside the router's
 * own feature extractor** — nothing rendered it, nothing summarized it, and
 * nothing reconciled it against the set of layers that are supposed to exist.
 *
 * That is a problem for a specific and load-bearing reason: we describe triage
 * as a multi-layer false-positive moat, but the shipped default enables only a
 * few of those layers (see `agent/features.ts`, which says so itself). Without
 * a reader, "the moat ran" is an assertion nobody can check — not in CI, not
 * in a report, not when a finding is questioned months later.
 *
 * This module makes the claim checkable. It answers, per finding:
 *   - which layers executed and what they decided,
 *   - which layers explicitly recorded that they were skipped, and why,
 *   - which layers left **no trace at all**.
 *
 * ## The honesty rule: read the record, not the environment
 *
 * A tempting shortcut is to report layer status from `features.*` — ask the
 * flags which layers are on and call those "ran". That would be wrong, and
 * dangerously so: findings are persisted and re-read later (`findings show`,
 * disclosure drafting, the benchmark data collector) under a *different*
 * environment than the scan ran in. Reading today's env would let a scan that
 * ran with the moat off be rendered, after the fact, as though the moat had
 * been on.
 *
 * So this module derives status **exclusively from the recorded verdicts**. If
 * a layer left no verdict, we say so plainly rather than inferring anything.
 * `features.*` is never consulted here — that is deliberate, not an oversight.
 *
 * ## The three statuses, and why `unrecorded` is not the same as `skipped`
 *
 * A layer that ran, and a layer that deliberately stood down, both leave a
 * verdict — the second with kind `"skip"` and a reason naming the flag or the
 * missing precondition. Those are `executed` and `skipped`.
 *
 * `unrecorded` is the third case and the one worth surfacing: no verdict of
 * any kind. It means we genuinely cannot say what happened. It has two causes
 * that a reader must be able to tell apart, so {@link LayerProvenance.reason}
 * distinguishes them:
 *
 *   1. **The layer has no instrumentation at all.** `structured_verify`,
 *      `consensus`, and `kernel_oracle` are declared in `TriageLayerName`,
 *      have registry entries, and are routable — but no code path in the
 *      engine emits a `LayerVerdict` for any of them. They are permanently
 *      invisible. See {@link UNINSTRUMENTED_LAYERS}.
 *   2. **The finding exited the pipeline early.** A finding rejected by
 *      `holding_it_wrong` never reaches `oracle`, so `oracle` has no verdict.
 *      That is correct behaviour and the absence is meaningful.
 *
 * Reporting both as a bare "skipped" would paper over (1), which is exactly
 * the kind of unfalsifiable moat claim this module exists to prevent.
 *
 * See `docs/src/content/docs/triage.md` for the operator-facing view, and
 * `agent/feature-presets.ts` for the preset that enables the full stack so an
 * A/B run becomes possible.
