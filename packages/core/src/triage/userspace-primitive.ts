/**
 * Userspace / Rust crash-to-primitive classification (xsec#698, Track C).
 *
 * The userspace analogue of `kernel-primitive.ts`. An ASan/UBSan/MSan report, a
 * Miri UB diagnostic, a Rust panic or a bare segfault proves a *bug* fired — but
 * not what an attacker can *do* with it. This module bridges that gap: from a
 * captured {@link CrashArtifact} it parses/symbolises the sanitizer / Miri /
 * panic text, labels the underlying memory-safety {@link MemPrimitive}
 * (use-after-free, heap-oob-write, ...), applies a controllability heuristic,
 * and emits an {@link ExploitabilityVerdict} the severity layer can fold in.
 *
 * Design notes (mirroring kernel-primitive.ts):
 *   - The classifier is pure and deterministic — it reads a `CrashArtifact` and
 *     returns an `ExploitabilityVerdict`. No I/O, no fuzz loop. Cheap to run on
 *     every captured crash and trivial to unit-test.
 *   - This is ASSIST-SCOPED. It labels a primitive and rates exploitability; it
 *     does NOT synthesise a working exploit, and labelling a primitive is a
 *     *hypothesis* about exploitability, not proof of it. The verify path
 *     (`pov-gate.ts`) is what flips a hypothesis to confirmed, and only when a
 *     PoC actually reproduces under the sanitizer build — the same skeptical,
 *     assume-false discipline the rest of the pipeline uses.
