/**
 * The PROVE stage as a PER-FINDING `HuntVerifier` — the missing adapter that
 * makes the kernel-VM exploitability oracle reachable from a real hunt.
 *
 * WHY this module exists (and why `makeKernelVmExploitabilityGate` could not be
 * wired directly): that factory binds its observation source at CONSTRUCTION
 * time — `KernelVmDiversifyRunnerDeps.reproducer` is a single string, and the
 * differential runner closes over one `buildExploit`. That shape is correct for
 * a one-bug PROVE run, but `runHuntScan` hands its gate MANY findings, each with
 * its OWN reproducer. Wiring the gate straight into `opts.exploitability` would
 * therefore boot every finding's oracle against the FIRST finding's reproducer
 * and silently attribute one bug's crash to another — the exact
 * false-attribution failure the oracle's canary binding exists to prevent.
 *
 * So this module constructs the gate ONCE PER FINDING, from that finding's own
 * reproducer and splat, and delegates to the existing
 * {@link makeExploitabilityGate} logic untouched. It adds no oracle semantics of
 * its own.
 *
 * INJECTION SEAM (load-bearing): `makeOracles` defaults to the REAL kernel-VM
 * oracles, which spawn QEMU. Every test in this repo passes a fake instead, so
 * the unit tests are fully offline. Do not remove the seam.
 *
 * HONESTY: a finding with no extractable reproducer is passed through
 * CONFIRMED-but-unproven rather than being rejected — the hunt's skeptic+prover
 * already confirmed it, and "we could not boot it" is not evidence against a bug.
