/**
 * Engine C — the mechanized-artifact oracle (xsec#1228).
 *
 * The FP-killer that converts LLM RECALL into PRECISION. The field's #1
 * convergent bottleneck (docs/operations/llm-lpe-innovation-plan.md): LLM
 * code-review has high recall but catastrophic precision — o3/ksmbd measured
 * 1:50 signal-to-noise with confidently-worded false positives; Windows
 * binary-RE hallucinates ~60% of high/critical decompiled findings. Nobody has
 * a cheap, SOUND oracle between "an LLM flagged a candidate" and "a weaponized
 * PoC". Our adversarial finder→skeptic→prover + the N× reproduction gate is
 * literally that missing piece — this module HARDENS it into a gate that
 * REJECTS any candidate that cannot carry a mechanized artifact.
 *
 * A "mechanized artifact" is the demand that separates a real bug from a
 * plausible-but-wrong one. A candidate is only CONFIRMED when it carries BOTH:
 *
 *   (1) a grep-verifiable STRUCTURAL PROOF — the exact two call sites / freed
 *       field / missing lock, named as needles that MUST literally exist in the
 *       real source (or the decompiled unit, for binary/Windows). This is the
 *       o3 lesson mechanized: the model may not hand-wave; every claim is
 *       checked against the bytes on disk, so a fabricated sink / an invented
 *       IOCTL code / a misread layout is caught deterministically. AND
 *
 *   (2) EITHER a reproduced sanitizer artifact (a real {@link CrashArtifact}
 *       that fired under ASan/UBSan/MSan/Miri/KASAN, N× reproduced — reusing
 *       the shipped {@link isReproducedMemCorruption} + N× reproduction gate),
 *       OR a BOUNDED STRUCTURAL CHECK — a small, decidable set of grep/AST
 *       assertions that together establish the specific invariant violation for
 *       a NON-crashing bug (a logic/auth/lifetime bug where no sanitizer oracle
 *       exists — the U1 whitespace: "no public demo of an LLM finding a
 *       non-crashing logic bug"). The bounded check does not prove
 *       exploitability (the model still reasons about that) — it mechanizes the
 *       STRUCTURAL FACTS the reasoning stands on.
 *
 * Relationship to {@link memCorruptionVerdict} (pov-gate.ts): that verdict is
 * the crash-side half — "did a sanitizer crash reproduce?". Engine C is
 * STRICTER: it demands the grep-verifiable structural proof FIRST, before it
 * will even trust a reproduced crash (a crash reproduced at a site the finding
 * mis-attributes is still an FP), and it extends coverage to the non-crashing
 * class the crash oracle is blind to.
 *
 * VERDICT SEMANTICS (mirrors {@link VerifyOutcome}, keeps the #518 discipline):
 *   - `rejected`    — a structural claim FAILED to grep-verify. This is a
 *                     MECHANIZED refutation: we proved the claim is fabricated
 *                     (the needle is not in the source). The one place Engine C
 *                     hard-drops, because we have machine proof it is wrong.
 *   - `confirmed`   — structural proof grep-verified AND (a reproduced sanitizer
 *                     crash OR a passing bounded structural check).
 *   - `inconclusive`— structural proof verified but no reproduction / bounded
 *                     check landed yet. HELD for the prover, never disclosed,
 *                     never silently dropped (a real bug that just isn't proven
 *                     yet must not be buried — the #518 failure mode).
 *
 * TESTABILITY: every side effect (reading source, reproducing a crash,
 * synthesising the artifact via an LLM) is an INJECTED seam, so the whole gate
 * is unit-testable with fakes — no VM, no network, no keys. Prod wires the real
 * source reader + the kernel-VM / sanitizer reproduce lane + the engine
 * runtime.
