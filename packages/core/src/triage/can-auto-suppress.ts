/**
 * Auto-suppression guardrail (issue #518)
 *
 * Standing operator rule: **never auto-drop or auto-submit a finding on a
 * classifier/heuristic score alone.** Several triage paths in the scanner are
 * flag-gated and, when enabled, can mark a finding `false-positive` and skip
 * all remaining triage/verification purely on a score or pattern heuristic
 * (evidence_gate, the learned XGBoost router's `auto_reject`, and the dynamic
 * triage router's empty-layer-set Rule-3).
 *
 * For a disclosure-grade pipeline, silently burying a real RCE / kernel
 * memory-corruption / auth-bypass is far worse than carrying a few extra false
 * positives into a verification pass. This module is the single chokepoint that
 * decides whether a finding is even *eligible* to be auto-suppressed by a
 * score/heuristic path. Every such path must route through
 * {@link canAutoSuppress} so a future 4th path cannot bypass the severity/class
 * guard.
 *
 * What this does NOT change:
 *   - Default-OFF flag behavior. When a flag is off, nothing here runs.
 *   - Low/medium-severity findings: they may still be deprioritized/suppressed
 *     by the score/heuristic paths exactly as before.
 *   - Verification-verdict suppressions (reachability analysis, multi-modal
 *     cross-validation, self-consistency vote). Those are real verification
 *     results, not score-only heuristics, and are out of scope for this guard.
 *
 * SINGLE SOURCE / PARITY (#650): the xcloud side keeps the same predicate +
 * severity/class guard in `@xcloud/cloud-contracts` `disclosure-worthiness.ts`
 * (the orchestrator can't import this engine package, and vice versa — the two
 * are decoupled by design). This module stays the engine's authoritative copy;
 * `can-auto-suppress.parity.test.ts` asserts the two `PROTECTED_SEVERITIES` /
 * `HIGH_IMPACT_CATEGORIES` lists agree. When you change a list here, update the
 * xcloud copy + both parity fixtures.
