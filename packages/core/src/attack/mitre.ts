// MITRE ATT&CK (Enterprise) mapping layer.
//
// Two lookups, both static and pure — no network, no ATT&CK STIX bundle at
// runtime, no inference:
//
//   techniquesForCategory(category)      finding category  → technique(s)
//   techniquesForEvent(eventType, tool)  pipeline event    → technique(s)
//
// Together they let an engagement report state, per finding and per logged
// agent action, which adversary behaviour the action corresponds to. That is
// what makes a scan reconstructable against a defender's own ATT&CK coverage.
//
// ── Rules this file is held to ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 1. Every id/name/tactic here was checked against the live Enterprise matrix
//    on attack.mitre.org (2026-07-28). Nothing is invented. If you add an
//    entry, verify it on attack.mitre.org first — a fabricated technique id in
//    a client deliverable is worse than no id at all.
// 2. Exactly one `primary` per non-empty list, then at most two `secondary`
//    supporting techniques. Consumers that need a single tag take the primary.
// 3. Where a mapping would be a guess, the list is `[]` with a comment saying
//    why. An honest gap beats a wrong tag.
// 4. Parent technique over sub-technique whenever the sub-technique is not an
//    exact fit.
//
// ── Matrix-version note ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The current Enterprise matrix renames the tactic formerly published as
// "Defense Evasion" (TA0005) to **"Stealth"**, and T1211 "Exploitation for
// Defense Evasion" to "Exploitation for Stealth". The names below follow the
// current matrix. That is deliberate, not a typo — if a client's tooling is
// pinned to an older ATT&CK release, map "Stealth" back to "Defense Evasion"
// at the presentation layer rather than editing this file.
//
// ── Scope note: LLM/agent findings ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Enterprise ATT&CK has no technique for prompt injection, jailbreaking, or
// system-prompt extraction. Those behaviours live in MITRE ATLAS, a separate
// matrix with a separate id namespace (AML.T####), which would break every
// consumer that expects a T#### id. Those categories therefore return `[]`
// with the ATLAS technique named in a comment. Do not paper over the gap by
// borrowing a loosely-related Enterprise id.
