// MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for AI Systems) mapping layer.
//
// The sibling of `./mitre.ts`, deliberately built to the same shape:
//
//   atlasTechniquesForCategory(category)      finding category → technique(s)
//   atlasTechniquesForEvent(eventType, tool)  pipeline event   → technique(s)
//
// ── Why this file exists separately ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// Enterprise ATT&CK and ATLAS are complementary matrices with disjoint id
// namespaces (`T####` vs `AML.T####`). Enterprise has no technique for prompt
// injection, jailbreaking, or system-prompt extraction; ATLAS has no technique
// for a heap overflow or a SQL injection. A finding may therefore legitimately
// carry an ATT&CK tag, an ATLAS tag, both, or neither.
//
// The two mappings are never merged. A consumer that flattens them into one
// list produces a deliverable that claims coverage in a matrix the client does
// not run, which is the exact failure this split exists to prevent.
//
// ── Rules this file is held to ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Identical to `./mitre.ts`:
//
// 1. Every id, name and tactic below was checked against the machine-readable
//    ATLAS release `dist/v6/ATLAS-2026.06.yaml` from mitre-atlas/atlas-data
//    (release 2026.06, dated 2026-06-30) — the same data that backs
//    atlas.mitre.org. Nothing is invented. Verify additions against that file
//    before adding them; a fabricated technique id in a client deliverable is
//    worse than no id at all.
// 2. Exactly one `primary` per non-empty list, then at most two `secondary`
//    supporting techniques. Consumers that need a single tag take the primary.
// 3. Where a mapping would be a guess, the list is `[]` with a comment saying
//    why. An honest gap beats a wrong tag.
// 4. Parent technique over sub-technique whenever the sub-technique is not an
//    exact fit.
//
// ── Note on the ATT&CK module's ATLAS comments ────────────────────────────
//
// `./mitre.ts` names three ATLAS techniques in comments. Two use names ATLAS
// has since changed or that were never exact, and one is a misattribution.
// Checked against release 2026.06:
//
//   • AML.T0056 is "Extract LLM System Prompt", not "LLM Meta Prompt
//     Extraction" (the pre-5.x name).
//   • AML.T0051.001 is "Indirect" — injection arriving through a separate data
//     channel the model ingests (a page, a document, a database row). It is NOT
//     the multi-turn technique. ATLAS files multi-turn escalation under
//     AML.T0054 "LLM Jailbreak", whose description enumerates "Multi-turn
//     escalation / Crescendo" by name as a jailbreak strategy. `multi-turn`
//     is mapped accordingly below.
//
// mitre.ts is another author's file and its Enterprise mappings are verified;
// those comments are left alone rather than edited from here.
//
// ── Tactic field ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Several ATLAS techniques sit under more than one tactic. `tactic` carries a
// single real ATLAS tactic name so a client can look it up verbatim; where
// ATLAS lists more than one, the choice is stated in a comment on the catalog
// entry and the full set is named there.

  // nothing is gained by also asserting an AML id for it.
  //
  // The near-misses, and why they stay empty:
  //
  //   • `supply-chain` / `known-vulnerable-package` vs AML.T0010 "AI Supply
  //     Chain Compromise". T0010's sub-techniques are Hardware, AI Software,
  //     Data, Model, Container Registry and AI Agent Tool — the compromised
  //     artifact has to *be* an AI artifact. The category alone never
  //     establishes that, and a generic dependency advisory tagged AML.T0010
  //     would overstate an AI-supply-chain compromise that was not shown.
  //   • `ssrf`, `command-injection`, `code-injection` vs AML.T0049 "Exploit
  //     Public-Facing Application" / AML.T0050 "Command and Scripting
  //     Interpreter". These exist in ATLAS only as steps in a chain against an
  //     AI system. Applying them to every web finding would inflate the ATLAS
  //     coverage claimed for an engagement.
  //   • `information-disclosure` vs AML.T0057 "LLM Data Leakage". T0057 is
  //     prompted disclosure by a model. A leaked stack trace or directory
  //     listing is not that.
  //
  // If a specific finding genuinely is the AI-flavoured variant, the mapping
  // belongs on that finding, not on the whole category.
