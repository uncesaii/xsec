/**
 * Oversized tool-result spilling (the "spill" policy).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A security scan's tool output is routinely enormous: a full HTTP response
 * body, a 5 MB file read, a directory listing with thousands of entries, a
 * fuzzer log. Today every byte of that lands in the model conversation, and
 * because every tool iteration RESENDS the whole conversation, one large
 * result is billed again on every subsequent round. A real session burned
 * 779,532 input tokens in a single turn that way (see the turn-token budget
 * note in console/turn-engine.ts). The large result also crowds out earlier
 * evidence, which is the more expensive failure: the model forgets the finding
 * it was chasing because a directory listing pushed it out of the window.
 *
 * The fix, borrowed from the DeepSeek harness, is a SPILL: a result over a
 * threshold is written to a session-scoped file on disk, and what enters the
 * conversation is a bounded head preview plus an explicit locator telling the
 * model (a) that it did NOT receive everything, (b) exactly how big the real
 * output was, and (c) the exact call to make to read any part of the rest.
 *
 * The doctrine on that inline text is the same one `read-file-window.ts`
 * settled on for truncated reads: a bare `truncated: true` flag is technically
 * present but is not read as an instruction, and a model that half-reads a
 * file then cites it as complete produces exactly the hallucinated-evidence
 * class that AGENTS.md treats as a bright line. So the truncation is stated IN
 * the text, in the imperative, with the follow-up call spelled out.
 *
 * ## Units
 *
 * Every size in this module — `thresholdChars`, `previewChars`,
 * `originalChars`, and the `offset`/`limit` of {@link readSpill} — is counted
 * in JavaScript string length (UTF-16 code units), NOT bytes and not Unicode
 * scalar values. One unit is used everywhere so the number the model is shown
 * is the same number its `offset` is measured in.
 *
 * ## Wiring (not done here — this module is deliberately standalone)
 *
 * The producer side calls {@link spillIfLarge} where a tool result is turned
 * into conversation content (`stringifyToolResult` in console/turn-engine.ts)
 * and puts `result.inline` in the `tool_result` block. The retrieval side must
 * expose {@link readSpill} to the model as a tool whose name matches
 * `SpillConfig.retrievalTool` (default {@link DEFAULT_SPILL_RETRIEVAL_TOOL}) —
 * the inline text names that tool, so if it is not registered the locator is a
 * lie. Note that the existing `read_file` tool CANNOT stand in: it enforces
 * scope containment against the scanned source root, and spills live under the
 * per-user state dir, so it would refuse every spill path.
 *
 * ## Retention
 *
 * A spill file is ENGAGEMENT EVIDENCE — it is verbatim target output (response
 * bodies, tokens the target handed back, memory dumps). It is written 0600
 * inside a 0700 per-scan directory under the per-user state dir, and it is NOT
 * time-expired by anything in this module: nothing here deletes a file the
 * caller did not ask to delete, because a spill may be the only surviving copy
 * of the evidence behind a finding. Retention is therefore explicit and owned
 * by the scan lifecycle: call {@link pruneSpills} when the scan terminates (or
 * after its evidence pack has been exported) to drop the whole per-scan
 * directory. Until that call, spills persist across process restarts, which is
 * also what makes a resumed scan able to re-read them.
