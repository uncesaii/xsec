/**
 * Python kernel tool definition (Phase-0 `python_exec`).
 *
 * A persistent, COMPUTE-ONLY Python REPL for payload construction, parsing,
 * crypto, and encoding work. State persists across calls within a scan. When
 * an engagement scope is active the kernel blocks all networking at the socket
 * source — the agent must use `http_request` for HTTP and file evidence via
 * `save_finding`.
 *
 * Pure `ToolDefinition` metadata (name / description / parameter schema). The
 * ./tools/index.ts barrel merges this into the canonical `TOOL_DEFINITIONS`
 * registry; the matching runtime handler (`pythonExec`) lives on the
 * `ToolExecutor` class in agent/tools.ts.
