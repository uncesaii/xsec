/**
 * OAST (out-of-band interaction) tool definitions (xsec#659 — split out of the
 * monolithic agent/tools.ts registry, mirrors intel.ts / cloud.ts).
 *
 * Two tools let the native loop weaponize blind/out-of-band classes mid-scan:
 *
 *   - `oast_register` mints a unique interaction handle (unique subdomain +
 *     correlation token) from the hosted collaborator. The agent injects the
 *     returned `http_url` / `dns_host` into a candidate payload for blind SSRF,
 *     blind XSS, OOB RCE, OOB-SQLi, XXE-OOB, or JNDI/log4shell.
 *   - `oast_poll` polls the collaborator for that handle and runs the OAST
 *     oracle (correlation-token matching) to return a confirmed/inconclusive
 *     verdict. A confirmed callback is fed into the loot ledger for chaining.
 *
 * Pure `ToolDefinition` metadata; the runtime handlers live on the
 * `ToolExecutor` class in agent/tools.ts, routed by `oastDispatch` below.
