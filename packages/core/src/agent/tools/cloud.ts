/**
 * Cloud-surface tool definitions (xsec#925, part of #923 CodeWall parity).
 *
 * Live AWS cloud testing — the BCG-post angle xsec was blind to. Three tools,
 * all READ/VERIFY-ONLY:
 *   - cloud_s3_probe          — public-bucket / ACL testing + orphaned-bucket
 *                               takeover detection (NoSuchBucket → re-creatable).
 *   - cloud_validate_credentials — safe validation of a harvested AWS key via
 *                               sts:GetCallerIdentity + read-only over-privilege
 *                               probes (no mutation, ever).
 *
 * Pure `ToolDefinition` metadata; the runtime handlers live on the
 * `ToolExecutor` class in agent/tools.ts and are routed by `cloudDispatch`.
 * Feature-gated behind XSEC_FEATURE_CLOUD_SURFACE (default OFF) AND
 * engagement-scope gated, deny-by-default (#924 parity): cloud probing is recon
 * against the target org, so it only runs for an authorized engagement scope.
 *
 * AWS/S3 is the MVP. Azure (Blob SAS / orphaned CNAME) and GCP (GCS ACL) are
 * deferred follow-ups — see agent/cloud-surface.ts header.
