/**
 * Windowed reads for the `read_file` agent tool.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Before this module `read_file` could only ever return the FIRST `max_lines`
 * lines of a file (default 500). There was no way to ask for the middle. For
 * the source-review and kernel-audit workloads that is the dominant read shape:
 * the agent greps, gets back `fs/xfs/xfs_ioctl.c:3421`, and then needs the 80
 * lines around 3421 — in a file that is 5000 lines long. The only escape hatch
 * was to shell out (`run_command: sed -n '3380,3460p' file`), which costs an
 * extra turn, produces output the loop does not track as a source-file read
 * (see `_sourceFilesRead` in agent/tools.ts — only `read_file` feeds the
 * coverage gate), and is a strictly worse interface than the tool that already
 * exists.
 *
 * The second, quieter failure was silent truncation. The old handler returned
 * `{ content, totalLines, truncated }`. `truncated: true` is technically in the
 * JSON the model sees, but it is a bare boolean with no instruction attached —
 * in practice models read the 500 lines, see no more, and reason as if the file
 * ended there. A finding built on a file the agent only half-read is exactly
 * the "hallucinated file/line reference" class that AGENTS.md flags as a
 * HackerOne bright-line violation. So truncation is now stated IN the returned
 * text, in the imperative, with the exact follow-up call to make.
 *
 * ## Why the logic lives here and not in the ToolExecutor
 *
 * Same reason as `apply-patch.ts` and `scope-path.ts`: the windowing is pure
 * (string in, window out) and deserves direct unit tests that do not have to
 * stand up a `ToolExecutor`, a `ToolContext`, a scope root and a temp dir just
 * to assert an off-by-one. The handler in agent/tools.ts keeps the I/O and the
 * scope enforcement; this file keeps the arithmetic.
 *
 * ## Line numbering convention
 *
 * `offset` is 1-BASED and matches `grep -n` / `rg -n` / `sed -n 'Np'` / the
 * `file.c:247` citation format used in `evidence_request`. This is deliberate:
 * the overwhelmingly common call sequence is grep → read around the hit, and a
 * 0-based offset would make the agent silently read one line off from every
 * line number the rest of its toolchain reports. A 0-based `offset` is
 * therefore REJECTED rather than clamped — clamping 0 to 1 would hand back a
 * window that is right by accident and teach the model nothing, while an error
 * that names the convention is recovered from in one turn.

 * string — but `read_file` output is already classified UNTRUSTED and passes
 * through `sanitizeUntrustedToolResult` before it re-enters model context, so
 * spoofing this line buys an attacker nothing they cannot already do by
 * writing "ignore previous instructions" into the same file.

 * field and is left alone on purpose: `split("\n")` indices ARE the 1-based
 * line numbers every other tool in the chain reports, and changing the count
 * now would silently move the meaning of a field callers already log.
 *
 * An `offset` past EOF is NOT an error. It returns an empty window with a note
 * saying so — the agent asked a well-formed question about a file that is
 * shorter than it assumed, and the useful answer is "the file has N lines",
 * not a thrown exception that costs a turn.
