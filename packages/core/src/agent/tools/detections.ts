/**
 * Detection tool definitions (xsec #774 / #775) — exposes the
 * structural-SQLi and prompt-layer detection engines as first-class agent
 * tools so the live loop can invoke them, not just the JIT skill methodology.
 *
 * - structural_sqli_probe: drives the JSON-key break/balance refinement loop
 *   over real HTTP (the McKinsey-class vector standard scanners miss).
 * - prompt_layer_probe: classifies the WRITE impact of a prompt-layer DB asset
 *   the agent has already read (verification-only; performs no writes).
 *
 * Pure `ToolDefinition` metadata; the runtime handlers live on the
 * `ToolExecutor` class in agent/tools.ts and are routed by `detectionDispatch`.
