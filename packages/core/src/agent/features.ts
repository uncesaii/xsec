/**
 * Feature flags for A/B testing agent improvements.
 * Set via environment variables: XSEC_FEATURE_<NAME>=0 to disable.
 *
 * NOTE on defaults:
 *   - "stable" features (early stop, loop detection, context compaction,
 *     script templates, progress handoff) default ON.
 *   - "experimental" features (playbooks, memory, web search) default OFF.
 *   - "v0.6.0 FP moat layers" (povGate, reachabilityGate, multiModal,
 *     selfConsistencyVerify) ALSO default OFF — they need explicit enablement
 *     in CI before any FP-moat A/B claim can be made.
 *   - "always-on triage filters" (`holdingItWrong`, `evidenceGate`) default
 *     ON — they're the only filters that ran in every v0.6.0 ablation, so
 *     they need to be ablatable.
 *
 * ## Enabling the full FP moat for an A/B
 *
 * The "explicit enablement" noted above now has one documented form, so an
 * A/B run does not depend on reconstructing the flag set by reading source:
 *
 *   env XSEC_FEATURE_PRESET=fp-moat xsec scan …
 *   xsec scan --features fp-moat …
 *
 * The preset's membership lives in `agent/feature-presets.ts` and is pinned by
 * test. Applying it never overwrites a flag that is already set, so
 * `env XSEC_FEATURE_POV_GATE=0 xsec …` alongside the preset gives you a clean
 * single-layer ablation.
 *
 * Enabling layers is only half of a defensible claim; the other half is being
 * able to show which layers ran on a given finding. That is
 * `triage/provenance.ts` (`summarizeTriageProvenance`), which reads the
 * recorded `layerVerdicts` rather than these flags — deliberately, since a
 * finding is usually re-read under a different environment than it was
 * produced in. It also reports which layers emit no telemetry at all
 * (`structured_verify`, `consensus`, `kernel_oracle` — see
 * `UNINSTRUMENTED_LAYERS`), because a layer we cannot observe cannot be part
 * of a moat claim.
