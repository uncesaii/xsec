/**
 * Task-drift detection — is the agent still working the thing it said it was
 * working on?
 *
 * The engine already had two things that look adjacent and are not:
 *
 * - `LoopDetector` (`agent/native-loop.ts`) catches an agent REPEATING itself
 *   (same fingerprint 3× in a row, or A-B-A-B). That is stuckness, not drift.
 *   A drifting agent is the opposite shape: it is doing something new every
 *   turn, none of it related to the objective, so every loop-detector signature
 *   is unique and it never fires.
 * - The percentage-keyed prompts (`buildContinuePrompt`, 30/50/70/85%) and the
 *   Strix budget warnings are keyed on BUDGET CONSUMED, not on content. They
 *   fire on a perfectly focused run and a completely derailed one identically,
 *   because neither one looks at what the agent is actually doing.
 *
 * Nothing measured divergence from the assigned objective. This does.
 *
 * ## The signal, and why it is deterministic rather than an LLM call
 *
 * Per turn, we compute lexical **anchor contact**: does this turn's activity
 * share any content term with the objective plus the currently OPEN plan tasks?
 * Drift is declared when contact has been absent for `streakThreshold`
 * consecutive scored turns.
 *
 *   ambient  = tokens(target) ∪ NOISE_TERMS
 *   anchor   = (tokens(objective) ∪ tokens(open plan tasks)) − ambient
 *   activity = tokens(tool names + tool arguments this turn) − ambient
 *   contact  = |anchor ∩ activity| >= 1
 *
 * Subtracting `ambient` is the part that makes this work at all. `config.target`
 * appears verbatim in essentially every `http_request` / `crawl` / `bash` call
 * an agent makes, so leaving the target host in the anchor set would make
 * contact permanently true and the detector permanently silent — a
 * false-NEGATIVE machine. Hitting the target is what the agent does by
 * definition; it carries no information about whether it is on-task. The same
 * reasoning removes HTTP/JSON boilerplate (`method`, `headers`, `true`, `json`,
 * …), which is present in every tool call regardless of intent.
 *
 * An LLM-judged alternative ("ask a cheap model each turn whether this is still
 * on-task") was rejected. The comparison that matters is not accuracy in the
 * abstract, it is accuracy per dollar per turn in a loop that already re-sends
 * the whole transcript every turn:
 *
 * - **Cost.** A per-turn judge call on a 40-turn run is 40 extra model calls
 *   per agent, and the engine fans agents out (specialists, EGATS branches,
 *   the verify wave). Measured verify-call cost in this codebase runs ~$0.55
 *   per LLM verification pass; even at a tenth of that, a per-turn judge is a
 *   double-digit-percent tax on scan cost to police a failure mode that does
 *   not occur on most runs. The token cost of THIS detector is zero — it never
 *   touches the network.
 * - **Latency.** It sits on the critical path of every turn.
 *   `Set.prototype.has` does not.
 * - **Determinism.** A judge that itself hallucinates drift injects a
 *   re-anchoring message into a healthy run, and it does so nonreproducibly,
 *   which makes the feature impossible to A/B honestly. This detector is a pure
 *   function of the trajectory: same run in, same warnings out, every time.
 * - **Circularity.** The judge would be the same model family that is drifting,
 *   asked to notice that it is drifting, from the same context that caused it.
 *
 * The honest summary is that the deterministic signal is a coarser instrument
 * bought at ~1/1000th the cost, and coarseness is affordable here because the
 * intervention is a short advisory message rather than a hard stop.
 *
 * ## What this signal genuinely cannot see (read this before trusting it)
 *
 * 1. **Lexically-disguised drift.** An agent that abandons the objective but
 *    keeps using the objective's vocabulary — endlessly re-probing an already-
 *    proven SQLi while the plan says "move to the auth bypass" — stays in
 *    contact on every turn and never trips. This is probably the most common
 *    real drift mode, and this detector misses it. Catching it needs semantics.
 * 2. **Legitimate pivots read as drift.** Discovering a new host, a new
 *    subdomain, or an unplanned CVE lead produces genuinely novel vocabulary
 *    with zero anchor overlap. This is the primary false-positive source and it
 *    is not a bug in the tokenizer — a real pivot and a real derail are
 *    lexically indistinguishable. The mitigations are structural, not clever:
 *    the streak requirement (a single exploratory turn never fires), the
 *    `plan`/`save_finding` reset (an agent recording progress is by definition
 *    on-task, whatever the words say), and an intervention that is advisory —
 *    the message explicitly tells the agent that if the new direction is right,
 *    the correct response is to ADD it to the plan, not to abandon it. A false
 *    positive therefore costs one short message and produces a useful side
 *    effect (the plan gets updated) rather than derailing the run.
 *
 *    The sharpest instance of this, and the one to keep in mind before turning
 *    the flag on for white-box work: **an agent reading unfamiliar code in
 *    order to REACH the objective.** A `read_file` / `grep` walk through a
 *    codebase it has never seen produces filenames, symbols and framework
 *    vocabulary that match nothing in the plan, even though the reading is
 *    exactly the right thing to be doing. The streak requirement is what makes
 *    this survivable — four consecutive turns of source navigation with no
 *    contact at all is genuinely a lot, and orientation reading normally
 *    touches an anchored term as soon as it opens a file belonging to the
 *    subsystem the plan names. It is nevertheless the case that a long
 *    orientation pass on a large unfamiliar tree WILL trip this detector, and
 *    that is an accepted false positive rather than a solved problem. Two
 *    tests below pin both halves of the behavior. If this proves noisy on
 *    audit/review roles, raise `streakThreshold` for those roles rather than
 *    widening the noise list, which would cost real signal.
 * 3. **An empty or generic plan.** With fewer than `minAnchorTerms` distinct
 *    anchor terms the detector disables itself entirely rather than guessing.
 *    A run whose objective is "find vulnerabilities" and whose plan is empty
 *    has nothing to drift FROM, and firing there would be noise by
 *    construction.
 *
 * **No false-positive rate is claimed.** Quantifying it requires labelled
 * trajectories — replaying stored XBOW/CyberGym runs through the monitor and
 * having a human mark which fires were genuine derails — and that corpus does
 * not exist yet. Until it does, this ships behind a default-OFF flag. The
 * structural claim being made is narrower and testable from the code: the
 * detector cannot fire on a run that maintains anchor contact, cannot fire more
 * than `maxWarnings` times, and cannot fire on a run with a thin anchor set.
 */

/**
 * Tokens too common to carry intent. Anything here appears across on-task and
 * off-task turns alike, so counting it as contact would only manufacture
 * false negatives. Kept deliberately short — the `ambient` subtraction of the
 * target string does most of the real work, and an over-long stoplist starts
 * removing genuine signal (`admin`, `token`, `upload` are all noise-adjacent
 * and all meaningful).
