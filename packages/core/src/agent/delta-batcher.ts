/**
 * Token-level delta batcher.
 *
 * The Responses API streams `response.output_text.delta` events at roughly
 * one fragment per BPE token (≈ 50–100 events/sec on a fast model). Forwarding
 * each one as its own `XSEC_EVENT_DELTA` line on stdout would:
 *
 *   - Spam the cloud worker-controller's stdout parser at line-noise rates
 *     (the parser does a JSON.parse per line — quadratic worst-case if
 *     buffering is involved).
 *   - Push 50+ INSERTs/sec into `scan_events` on the dashboard side, which
 *     swamps the SSE fan-out and the React rendering tree.
 *
 * So we coalesce. Each (turn, scope) gets its own `DeltaBatcher` that
 * accumulates `text` chunks into a buffer and flushes to the bus when ANY
 * of the following bounds are crossed:
 *
 *   (a) Buffer size ≥ 256 chars (prevents unbounded memory growth on a long
 *       single-message response that keeps streaming for minutes).
 *   (b) ≥ 100 ms have elapsed since the FIRST chunk in the current buffer
 *       (caps end-to-end latency from token-on-the-wire to dashboard render
 *       at ~100 ms regardless of stream rate).
 *   (c) `flushNow()` is called explicitly — used at agent-turn boundaries
 *       so the trailing partial buffer is never left dangling when the
 *       stream ends.
 *
 * Why these specific numbers:
 *
 *   - 256 chars ≈ ~64 tokens ≈ a sentence or two — a sensible chunk for
 *     the dashboard to render in one paint, and small enough that the
 *     blinking-cursor UX doesn't feel laggy when (b) doesn't fire because
 *     the model is producing text fast.
 *   - 100 ms is below the human-perceptible-latency threshold (~150 ms),
 *     so the streaming text feels live even when (a) doesn't fire because
 *     the model is producing text slowly.
 *
 * The batcher is a tiny, dependency-free helper — it doesn't know about
 * the event bus directly. The caller passes a flush callback that does
 * the actual `eventBus.emit("delta", …)` plus seq accounting. This keeps
 * the unit tests fast (no bus state, no fake timers needed for the trivial
 * cases) and lets the agent loop own the seq counter.
