/**
 * Hybrid confidence signal for findings.
 *
 * Background — the cloud-side `findings.confidence` column (numeric(4,3),
 * range 0.000–1.000) was 100% NULL because xsec-cli never emitted a
 * confidence value on findings: the OSS `Finding` type carried the field
 * but the `save_finding` agent tool didn't accept it, the JSON / structured
 * findings parser hard-coded `confidence: undefined`, and the
 * `finding_ingested` event payload didn't propagate it. This helper adds
 * the missing source-of-truth.
 *
 * We use strategy (c) — hybrid:
 *
 *   1. **LLM self-report.** `save_finding` now accepts an optional
 *      `confidence: number` (0..1). The agent reports its own calibration.
 *   2. **PoC-status floor.** LLMs are notoriously badly calibrated, so we
 *      clamp the LLM's value UP to a floor based on what the codebase
 *      actually has evidence for:
 *        - no PoC step graph attached         → no floor (LLM word alone)
 *        - pocSteps present                   → floor 0.6
 *        - pocSteps with at least one
 *          verifiable `expect` predicate      → floor 0.8
 *
 *      "Verifiable" here means the step graph asserts something concrete the
 *      behavioural re-verify executor will check (HTTP status, body match,
 *      file-exists, exit-zero), not just a `note`. A finding the agent
 *      bothered to encode as a structured PoC plan is, empirically, much
 *      more likely to be a true positive than one with prose-only evidence.
 *
 *   3. **Floor never exceeds 1.0.** Final value is clamped to [0,1].
 *
 * If neither signal is present (no LLM number, no PoC steps), we return
 * `undefined` — better an honest absence than a fabricated 0.5.
 *
 * The thresholds (0.6 / 0.8) are heuristic; the operator may want to
 * recalibrate them once we have ground-truth data from the cloud triage
 * pipeline. They're picked to match the existing convention in
 * `agentic-scanner.ts` where reachability/multi-modal layers already cap
 * confidence around 0.7 and the oracle layer hard-sets 1.0.
