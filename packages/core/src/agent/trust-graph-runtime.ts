/**
 * Trust-graph loop wiring (xsec#771, connects #786 + #780).
 *
 * This is the OPT-IN bridge that connects the durable
 * {@link PersistentCredentialStore} (credential-store.ts, #786) and the
 * `credential_shared` journal kind (journal/credential-shared.ts, #780) into the
 * single-scan native agent loop (native-loop.ts).
 *
 * Design contract — the whole point of this module:
 *
 *   The native loop's default, single-scan behaviour MUST be byte-identical to
 *   before. Every durable-store interaction is gated on an OPTIONAL
 *   `trustGraph` config block. When that block is absent the loop never
 *   constructs a {@link TrustGraphSession}, so there is zero new I/O and zero
 *   behaviour change. This is asserted by a test that runs the loop with no
 *   `trustGraph` config and proves the store receives zero calls.
 *
 * When the block IS present, a {@link TrustGraphSession} owns three additive
 * behaviours, each a thin call into the already-tested #786/#780 surface:
 *
 *   1. {@link TrustGraphSession.renderPriorFootholds} — at loop start, render
 *      prior-scan footholds for this target (hash + redacted preview only) to
 *      inject alongside the normal in-scan loot render.
 *   2. {@link TrustGraphSession.persist} — when loot is harvested / on loop
 *      completion, persist newly-found credentials (hash + preview only; the
 *      plaintext never leaves the in-memory ledger).
 *   3. {@link TrustGraphSession.noteHarvest} — when a harvested value's hash
 *      matches a credential a PRIOR scan recovered from a DIFFERENT source
 *      target, that's a cross-target reuse: emit a `credential_shared` journal
 *      entry (source target, dest target, kind, originating finding).
 *
 * The store is referenced through the structural {@link CredentialStoreLike}
 * interface (a subset of {@link PersistentCredentialStore}) so tests can inject
 * a spy double and assert exact call counts without a real DB.
