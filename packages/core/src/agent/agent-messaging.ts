/**
 * Agent-to-agent messaging policy + delivery (subagent coordination).
 *
 * The hub transport (`hub/mailbox.ts`) already gives us a crash-safe local
 * spool that guarantees message bytes are safe to *display*. This module is the
 * layer ABOVE it that decides:
 *
 *   1. WHO MAY ADDRESS WHOM ({@link decideAddressing}) — a pure function of the
 *      sender's role/identity and the operator's channel settings. No
 *      filesystem, no clock, no session. This is where the security policy
 *      lives, expressed as code rather than convention so a test can pin it.
 *   2. HOW A DELIVERED BODY RE-ENTERS A MODEL CONTEXT
 *      ({@link renderInboundMessage}) — every inbound body is UNTRUSTED input
 *      authored by another agent (a direct agent-to-agent prompt-injection
 *      vector). Before it reaches a model it is routed through the codebase's
 *      existing untrusted-input defense (`sanitizeUntrustedToolResult`) and
 *      delivered FENCED and ATTRIBUTED (`peer <id> said: "…"`), never as bare
 *      text that reads like an instruction.
 *
 * ## The decided policy
 *
 *   - parent → child: ALLOWED (the parent is the curated trust boundary).
 *   - child → parent: ALLOWED, ALWAYS, and deliberately NOT a setting. This is
 *     the coordination channel the whole feature exists for — a child that
 *     cannot report upward is a child that cannot be re-tasked — so there is no
 *     operator toggle that turns it off. Its risk is already carried by the
 *     delivery path below (sanitized, fenced, attributed, bounded), which is the
 *     same protection every other channel gets.
 *   - child → sibling: gated on `siblingChannelEnabled`. Children run
 *     attacker-influenced code, so a direct sibling channel is how one
 *     compromised child reaches another's context. The operator decides.
 *   - child → operator: gated on `operatorChannelEnabled` AND on the parent
 *     having supplied {@link MessagingRuntime.operatorId}. A child cannot derive
 *     that id: it is not the parent id, and it is explicitly excluded from the
 *     sibling-prefix rule so a misconfigured prefix can never expose it.
 *   - child → any other session: DENIED. There is no configured id for it, so
 *     nothing matches and it collapses into the generic denial.
 *   - child → broadcast (`to: "all"`): DENIED unconditionally, no setting. A
 *     broadcast from a leaf is a fan-out amplifier — one compromised child
 *     reaching every peer in the roster at once — and a child that needs to
 *     reach several peers can address them one at a time under the rules above.
 *
 * ## Authority stays human-gated
 *
 * Nothing in this module or the delivery path mutates authorization state: no
 * scope grant, no tool approval, no autonomy-mode change, no gate lift. A
 * message is inert prose. {@link decideAddressing} returns a verdict; it does
 * not, and cannot, grant anything. This is asserted by test.
 *
 * ## No roster leak on denial
 *
 * A denial NEVER names another peer, and never says WHICH rule refused. An
 * attempt to reach a sibling while that channel is off, the operator while that
 * channel is off, or an id that simply does not exist all collapse to the SAME
 * generic "recipient is not reachable" reason. Byte-identical denials are what
 * stop a child from probing either the roster or the operator's settings by
 * watching which addresses are refused differently.

 *     {@link GENERIC_DENY_REASON} (no roster leak, no settings leak).

 *   - it is gated by the SAME operator↔child channel toggle
 *     ({@link MessagingRuntime.operatorChannelEnabled}) the child→operator
 *     direction already reads: disabling that channel shuts BOTH directions.
 *   - when a live roster is pinned ({@link MessagingRuntime.knownPeerIds}) the
 *     target must be on it, so a dead/unknown agent id is refused cleanly.
 *   - broadcast is NOT part of steering: address one running peer.
 *   - self and shape-invalid ids are refused, same as every other role.

 *   no field a child/parent verdict depends on, so no existing deny weakens.
