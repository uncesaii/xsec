/**
 * Inline validation (validate-on-save) — issue #554.
 *
 * All verification used to run as a post-attack BATCH pass in agentic-scanner
 * (reachability gate, PoV gate, structured verify). During the attack, the
 * agent got NO real-time truth signal: it could burn 40–100 turns chasing a
 * lead that's actually unreachable or unprovable, and EGATS scored branches on
 * regex POSITIVE/NEGATIVE signals rather than confirmed exploitation.
 *
 * This module is the cheap end of that verification, pulled INTO the loop: when
 * the attack agent saves a high/critical finding, we re-run the same
 * deterministic category oracle (`verifyOracleByCategory` from triage/oracles —
 * the #553 PoV-gate→oracle delegation) against the finding's own evidence and
 * return a `{confirmed, inconclusive, reason}` verdict.
 *
 * Discipline (mirrors the PoV gate's `adjudicateWithOracle`):
 *   - oracle verifies                  → confirmed:true
 *   - oracle clean-fails (no reproduce)→ confirmed:false, inconclusive:false
 *   - oracle infra-error / throws      → confirmed:false, inconclusive:true
 *
 * An inline error is ALWAYS inconclusive, NEVER a false-positive: the finding
 * still flows through the full batch verification later. We never downgrade or
 * suppress a finding off this signal.
