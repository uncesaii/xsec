/**
 * Flag-boundary tests for the SOP surfaces: dynamic playbooks and the `plan`
 * tool.
 *
 * These exist because every one of these features is a getter reading an env
 * var at call time (so the CLI `--features` flag, which mutates the env AFTER
 * this module is imported, is honored). That pattern is easy to regress into a
 * const, at which point the flag silently stops working — and a silently
 * ignored feature flag is worse than no flag, because ablation runs would
 * report a difference that was never applied.
