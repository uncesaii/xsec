// Shared per-scan cost ledger.
//
// A single scan run drives MULTIPLE agent sessions: the unified pipeline
// runs one research session plus a concurrent blind-verify wave (one session
// per finding), and the per-file research loop runs one session per source
// file. Each session tracks its own `state.totalUsage` from zero, so a hard
// per-scan cost ceiling checked against session-local usage binds every
// session individually but never the scan as a whole — a $3 ceiling still
// allowed research($3) + N × verify($3) of real spend (prod 0review scans
// landed at $4.99 / $6.36 against the $3 ZERO_REVIEW_COST_CEILING_USD).
//
// The fix is this ledger: the pipeline creates ONE instance per run and
// threads it through every agent session. Each native-loop turn adds its
// token usage here, and the per-turn ceiling check prices the ledger's
// cross-session cumulative total instead of the session's alone. Verify
// sessions run concurrently (Promise.all); since each adds only its own
// usage and reads the shared total, the wave trips within one turn of the
// collective spend crossing the ceiling (overshoot bounded by one in-flight
// turn per active session).
//
// The ledger is also the source of truth for the scan_completed event's
// cost_usd + per-model cost_breakdown, so the cloud sees the true
// cross-session cumulative rather than any single session's segment.
