// Authorized-engagement scanner profile (xsec#926).
//
// The structured scanner wrappers (run_sqlmap/run_nmap/run_ffuf/run_nuclei,
// xsec#555) are powerful but loud: they fingerprint themselves on the wire
// and fan many requests internally. The stealthy default (xsec#217) is to
// keep them OFF — `allowScanners` is unset, so the wrappers aren't even in the
// tool set. That default is correct and MUST NOT change.
//
// This module is the single gate that decides, per scanner invocation, whether
// the engagement is an *authorized* one in which the suite may run. It bundles
// the "authorized-engagement profile" contract into one pure verdict function
// so the four scanner handlers share identical discipline (no per-handler
// drift) and tools.ts stays surgical.
//
// The contract reuses the existing http_audit / scope constraint vocabulary
// (ScopePolicy host allowlist, EnforcementTracker's PathPolicy + wall-clock
// kill switch, per-host RateLimiter) and mirrors the deny-by-default rails the
// active-subdomain brute-force adopted (recon/active-subdomains.ts):
//
//   1. ENABLED      — `allowScanners === true`. Default OFF: with the flag
//                     unset the wrappers are absent from the tool set AND this
//                     gate hard-refuses (defense-in-depth).
//   2. SCOPED       — an engagement `ScopePolicy` MUST be present. With NO
//                     scope policy the gate refuses (deny-by-default): an
//                     authorized engagement is always an explicitly scoped one,
//                     so an un-scoped scanner run is a configuration error, not
//                     a free-for-all. This closes the prior gap where
//                     `allowScanners` alone (no scope) let a scanner hit any
//                     host.
//   3. IN-SCOPE     — the per-invocation target host must match the scope
//                     policy, and (when an EnforcementTracker carries a path
//                     allowlist) the target path must match a permitted prefix.
//   4. NOT-KILLED   — the wall-clock kill switch (EnforcementTracker) must not
//                     have fired; a time-boxed engagement that has run out of
//                     budget refuses further scanner launches.
//
// Rate limiting stays where it already lives (the caller acquires a per-host
// token after this gate passes); this module only renders the allow/deny
// decision so it is trivially unit-testable without IO.
