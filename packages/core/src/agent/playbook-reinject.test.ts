/**
 * End-to-end test for playbook re-injection through a REAL in-loop compaction.
 *
 * The defect: playbook injection was one-shot (`playbookInjected` latch, single
 * message push). The methodology lived only in the transcript, so a
 * `compactMessagesWithLLM` pass could erase it and nothing ever put it back.
 * Beyond losing the guidance, this contaminated evaluation — whether the
 * feature's own content was present at the end of a run depended on whether a
 * compaction happened to land after the injection turn, so an A/B of
 * `dynamicPlaybooks` would partly have been measuring compaction timing.
 *
 * This drives `runNativeAgentLoop` for real: the agent runs `bash` (local, no
 * network) emitting text that trips the SQLi indicators, the playbook is
 * injected at the 30% checkpoint, token usage is scripted high enough to force
 * a genuine compaction, and the loop is expected to notice the block is gone
 * and restore it from structured state.
 *
 * `dynamicPlaybooks` stays OFF by default — this only makes the mechanism
 * sound. The flag is enabled explicitly here and cleaned up after.
