/**
 * Typed TODO / plan ledger for long-horizon agent runs.
 *
 * Background — the engine had no representation of "what am I supposed to be
 * doing". The closest thing was `features.externalMemory` (default OFF), which
 * tells the agent to `echo` a JSON blob containing a free-text `"plan"` field
 * to a file (`agent/prompts.ts` EXTERNAL_MEMORY_INSTRUCTION) that is re-read
 * only at the >=30% reflection checkpoints, and only on turns where the model
 * emitted no tool calls at all (`buildContinuePrompt` → `readExternalMemory`).
 * Nothing parses it, nothing validates it, nothing notices when it goes stale,
 * and nothing can compare it against what the agent is actually doing. It is a
 * scratchpad, not a task list.
 *
 * Why this matters enough to add state: the cleanest controlled result in the
 * agentic-exploitation field right now is Tencent Xuanwu's Atuin, which moved
 * 68.7% → 84.0% on CyberGym holding the model FIXED (GLM-5.2) — the entire
 * delta came from harness design, and a named component of that design is that
 * agents maintain TODO lists which a workflow hook watches for task drift. A
 * tracked task list is also the only thing that makes drift *detectable*: you
 * cannot measure divergence from an objective that was never written down.
 * `agent/drift.ts` consumes this ledger for exactly that.
 *
 * Design follows `agent/loot.ts` (the LootLedger, xsec#567) deliberately,
 * because that module already solved the hard part of this problem in this
 * codebase: it is a typed, deduped, size-capped store carrying a monotonic
 * `revision`, and the agent loop re-renders a compact block from the STRUCTURED
 * STATE each turn rather than hoping the original message survives. That is
 * what makes it compaction-proof — `compactMessagesWithLLM` may summarize away
 * or drop the message that carried the plan, and the next turn simply re-renders
 * the identical block from `TaskLedger.render()`. Anything that lived only in
 * the transcript would be gone. Matching the LootLedger shape (same `revision`
 * getter, same `render({ limit })` signature, same "created only when the flag
 * is on, threaded through ToolContext" wiring) also means the loop's injection
 * throttle is the same code shape in both places.
 *
 * Two deliberate constraints, both of which exist to serve drift detection
 * rather than to be tidy for their own sake:
 *
 * 1. **At most one task is `active` at a time.** Starting task B automatically
 *    demotes an active task A back to `pending`. Without this the "current
 *    objective" is a set rather than a point, and "is the agent still working
 *    the assigned task" stops having an answer — every activity matches
 *    *something* in a five-way-active plan, so drift can never fire. It also
 *    reflects how the work actually runs: the loop is a single serial agent.
 * 2. **Tasks are typed and validated, never free text.** Every mutation goes
 *    through `applyPlanAction`, which parses against a Zod discriminated union
 *    and returns a rejection the loop hands straight back to the model as an
 *    `is_error` tool result so it can self-correct. This is the structured-
 *    output discipline `agent/AGENTS.md` §1 mandates for any agent-facing
 *    submission tool (the `kernel_run` / `kernelRunArgsSchema` pattern).
 *
 * The ledger is single-scan lifetime and in-memory, like the LootLedger. It is
 * not written to the findings DB: a plan is working state, not a scan artifact,
 * and persisting it would create a second, competing notion of scan progress
 * next to the execution journal (`agent/journal/`). Runs that resume from the
 * journal rebuild their plan the same way they rebuild everything else — by
 * re-reading the rehydrated conversation.
