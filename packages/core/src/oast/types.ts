/**
 * Out-of-band application security testing (OAST) — shared types (xsec#659).
 *
 * These types describe a hosted *interaction collaborator* (an interactsh-style
 * DNS + HTTP callback server we control) and the handles/interactions it hands
 * out. The point is to confirm the class of bug whose proof lives OUT of the
 * request/response we can see: blind SSRF, blind XSS, OOB RCE, OOB-SQLi,
 * XXE-OOB, JNDI/log4shell. The agent injects a unique collaborator URL/host
 * into a candidate payload; when the collaborator later records a DNS lookup or
 * HTTP request carrying that unique token, the interaction is provably tied to
 * that candidate and the finding flips from inconclusive to verified.
 *
 * This file is I/O-free on purpose: the correlation logic in `oracle.ts` is a
 * pure function of (handle, interactions), and the concrete server transport is
 * behind the `OastCollaborator` interface in `collaborator.ts`. That keeps the
 * testable core independent of whether the collaborator is in-memory (tests),
 * a self-hosted server (prod), or a third-party interactsh instance (adapter).
