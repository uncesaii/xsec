/**
 * OAST oracle — correlation-token matching for out-of-band verdicts (xsec#659).
 *
 * This is the core testable logic of the feature and carries NO I/O. Given a
 * handle's correlation token (and optionally a per-candidate nonce) plus the
 * interactions a collaborator recorded, it decides whether a blind/out-of-band
 * bug is *confirmed* — and by which channel. The "no exploit, no report"
 * principle in `triage/oracles.ts` applies here too: a verdict is only
 * `verified` when a recorded interaction provably carries our unique token on a
 * channel that makes sense for the vulnerability class.
 *
 * Why per-class channel rules matter: a DNS lookup proves the target resolved a
 * name we control (server-side) — enough for blind SSRF, OOB-RCE, OOB-SQLi,
 * XXE. But a DNS-only hit does NOT prove a script executed in a victim's
 * browser, so blind XSS requires an actual HTTP callback. Encoding that per
 * class is what stops us over-claiming.
