/**
 * Structured diagnostics channel for `@xsec/core`.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Library code inside core legitimately needs to tell the operator things:
 * "your plan quota is exhausted", "the retry budget is spent", "the fallback
 * chain entry was malformed". Historically it said them with
 * `process.stderr.write` / `console.error`. That works for a plain CLI run and
 * is actively destructive for the interactive console, which is a full-screen
 * OpenTUI app: the renderer owns every cell on screen and repaints
 * differentially, so any write it did not originate scrolls or overprints the
 * framebuffer and desynchronizes the renderer's model of the screen. The
 * visible result is ghost header rows, characters from one widget appearing
 * inside another, and a garbled status line.
 *
 * `packages/cli/src/tui/output-guard.ts` intercepts stray writes while the TUI
 * is mounted, but that is containment, not a cure: it cannot give library code
 * a *code* to react to, it cannot carry structured fields, and every new
 * `console.warn` anywhere in core or a dependency re-creates the hazard until
 * the guard happens to catch it. This module is the cure — one typed,
 * pluggable, fail-soft channel that core writes to instead of the terminal.
 *
 * It is deliberately shaped like the existing `EventBus` (`../events/bus.ts`):
 * pluggable sinks, fan-out, exceptions swallowed. It is a *separate* channel
 * rather than another `osecEvent` variant because the two have different
 * audiences and different failure semantics — bus events are scan telemetry
 * destined for the cloud relay and are load-bearing for the dashboard, while
 * diagnostics are operator-facing prose about the health of the run that no
 * consumer is required to persist.
 *
 * ## Delivery model
 *
 *     diag.warn(code, message, fields?)
 *            |
 *            +- sanitize (ANSI stripped, control chars stripped, length bounded)
 *            |
 *            +- claimed? --yes--> the claiming sink (e.g. the TUI)  [stderr silent]
 *            |                    + any additive observers
 *            |
 *            +---- no ---> built-in stderr sink + any additive observers
 *
 * ## The default-delivery decision: **stderr, not silent buffering**
 *
 * When nothing has claimed the channel, diagnostics go to `process.stderr`.
 *
 * The alternative — buffer silently until someone subscribes — optimizes for
 * the one consumer that is already able to defend itself and penalizes every
 * consumer that is not. The overwhelming majority of xsec invocations are
 * *not* the TUI: `xsec scan` in a terminal, a CI job, the cloud worker, a
 * shell pipeline redirecting stderr to a log. For all of those, a diagnostic
 * that is buffered and never drained is a diagnostic that is *lost*. Losing
 * "plan quota exhausted" means the operator watches a scan produce nothing and
 * has no idea why. That is a strictly worse bug than a corrupted frame.
 *
 * Meanwhile the TUI is a known, enumerable, code-owning consumer. It already
 * installs an output guard at mount; claiming the diagnostics channel in the
 * same place is one more line in code we control. "Safe by default" here means
 * *the process that owns the terminal opts out of stderr*, not *everybody
 * silently loses data so that one consumer does not have to ask*.
 *
 * A third property settles it: stderr-by-default makes the migration of the
 * ~68 existing raw writes a pure refactor. Every migrated call site keeps its
 * observable behaviour for non-TUI users, which is what makes it safe to
 * migrate them incrementally instead of in one risky sweep.
 *
 * The bounded ring buffer is still kept (see `recentDiagnostics`) so a late
 * claimer can replay what it missed — but it is a *replay* buffer, not the
 * primary delivery path.
 *
 * ## Guarantees
 *
 *   1. **Never throws into a scan.** Sanitization, sink dispatch, and the
 *      stderr write are each wrapped; the public methods have no throwing path
 *      at all. A sink that throws is isolated (and, if it is the claiming
 *      sink, its failure falls back to stderr so the message is not lost).
 *   2. **Inert text.** Messages and string fields have ANSI escape sequences
 *      and every C0/C1 control character removed, whitespace collapsed to
 *      single spaces, and length bounded. Nothing crossing into a renderer can
 *      move a cursor, set a colour, or open a new row.
 *   3. **Structured, not interpolated.** `fields` is carried as data all the
 *      way to the sink. It is never spliced into `message`. Only the built-in
 *      stderr renderer flattens it, and only at the very last step.
 *   4. **Zero dependencies.**
 *
 * ## Env controls
 *
 *   `XSEC_DIAG_LEVEL` — `off` | `error` | `warn` | `info` (default `info`).
 *   Filters at the source, before any sink sees the event. `off` silences the
 *   channel entirely.
