/**
 * Plugin loader — discovery, spawn, handshake, dispatch (xsec plugin system,
 * stages 2 + 3 of DESIGN.md).
 *
 * This is the HOST side of the boundary whose wire format lives in
 * `protocol.ts`. It is the only module that spawns a plugin, the only module
 * that decides a plugin's tools exist, and the only module that routes a call
 * into one. Everything it does is arranged around four invariants:
 *
 *  1. **One authorization path.** A contributed tool becomes visible to the
 *     engine ONLY through {@link PluginHost.registerTools}, which runs every
 *     tool through `gateFlagsFor` (the single capability→gate translation from
 *     `manifest.ts`) and stores the resulting flags alongside it. `gateMaps()`
 *     then derives the same three `Record<string, true>` shapes the built-ins
 *     use, so a plugin tool declaring `network` is gated by scope-on-demand and
 *     the yolo hard-deny exactly like `http_request`. There is no second,
 *     lighter path — DESIGN.md §2 calls that out as the naive-and-wrong design.
 *
 *  2. **Install ≠ enablement.** Discovery reads ONE explicitly configured
 *     directory under the per-user state dir. It never walks the project tree,
 *     and {@link PluginHost.load} refuses any plugin id absent from the
 *     caller-supplied `enabled` list. Dropping a directory on disk grants
 *     nothing — DESIGN.md §4, and the specific criticism we made of dsh.
 *
 *  3. **The child is untrusted.** It is spawned with no shell, a fixed argv, an
 *     explicit cwd, and an env built by `allowlistedChildEnv` MINUS the target
 *     auth block (see {@link buildPluginEnv}). It receives no scope object, no
 *     auth config, no credentials, and no handle to host state. Everything it
 *     sends back is decoded totally and, for anything reaching a model,
 *     sanitized through the codebase's existing untrusted-input defense.
 *
 *  4. **Fail-soft, always.** A plugin that crashes, hangs, floods stdout, or
 *     answers with garbage degrades to "that plugin is unavailable". It cannot
 *     throw into a turn, cannot block one past a bounded timeout, and cannot
 *     take the session down.
 *
 * ── A plugin CANNOT register a guard, hook, interceptor or listener ──────────
 *
 * This is deliberate and load-bearing, not an unimplemented feature. The wire
 * protocol has no message for it and this loader exposes no API for it: a
 * plugin contributes TOOLS and answers `call_tool`, full stop.
 *
 * The reason is the dsh flaw we are explicitly not reproducing. dsh's
 * `tools/pre-execute` waterfall lets a listener return without calling
 * `next()`, which short-circuits the remainder of the chain — i.e. any plugin
 * that can register an interceptor can SUPPRESS the authorization pipeline that
 * is supposed to be authorizing it. Since xsec's gates are the only thing
 * standing between a model and un-scoped egress on an authorized engagement,
 * handing that switch to third-party code would void the entire capability
 * model. So: guards are HOST-side only. `plugins/guards.ts` is deny-only and
 * monotonic by construction, its guard set is assembled in-process, and
 * model-authored guards are handled separately by `self-extension.ts`. An
 * out-of-process plugin has no way to add, reorder, or bypass any of them.
 *
 * ── Why `reload()` is only safe at a turn boundary ───────────────────────────
 *
 * A reload is a genuine restart: kill the child, respawn it, re-handshake,
 * re-validate the manifest, re-derive gate flags. It is emphatically NOT
 * module-cache surgery — there is no module to cache, which is one more reason
 * the subprocess design is the right one for hot-swap.
 *
 * The consequence is that a reload MUTATES THE GATE MAPS: tools disappear and
 * (possibly with different capabilities) reappear. The console resolves a
 * call's gate flags at several points spread across a single turn — scope
 * resolution, the yolo hard-deny, the local-directory prompt, the copilot
 * prompt, and the guard floor each read the maps independently. If the maps
 * changed between two of those reads, a call could be approved against one
 * capability set and executed against another: an operator could approve a
 * `filesystem-read` tool and have a reloaded, now-`network` tool run under that
 * approval. Reload must therefore be sequenced between turns, when no call is
 * in flight and no approval decision is outstanding. {@link PluginHost.reload}
 * rejects when the plugin has in-flight calls, but the caller still owns the
 * "no turn is running" half of that contract — the loader cannot see turns.
