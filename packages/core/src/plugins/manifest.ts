/**
 * Third-party plugin manifest — schema + validation (xsec plugin system, stage 1).
 *
 * This module is the FOUNDATION of the plugin system: the typed contract a
 * plugin declares itself against, and the pure validator that turns untrusted
 * input into either a trusted `PluginManifest` or a list of actionable errors.
 * Loading, sandboxing and dispatch are deliberately OUT of scope here (see
 * DESIGN.md, "staged plan"). Nothing in this file touches `process`, the
 * filesystem, the network, or stdout/stderr, and it has no dependencies — it is
 * pure and total so it can run anywhere (validator in the loader, in a preview
 * UI, in a test) without side effects.
 *
 * ── Why the capability model is the spine ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The console's authorization gates in `console/turn-engine.ts`
 * (`NETWORK_CAPABLE_TOOLS`, `LOCAL_SCOPE_TOOLS`, `READ_ONLY_TOOLS`) are keyed on
 * TOOL NAME. A built-in tool is dangerous-by-registration: it appears in those
 * maps, so scope-on-demand, the yolo hard-deny, the local-filesystem gate and
 * the co-pilot approval prompt all fire on it. A plugin-contributed tool whose
 * name is absent from every map would be treated as the LEAST dangerous class:
 * no scope approval, not network-capable, no co-pilot confirmation — a complete
 * bypass of every gate, on a product whose whole job is authorized offensive
 * testing and which (per its own docs) does not sandbox by default.
 *
 * So capability declaration here is MANDATORY and FAIL-CLOSED:
 *   - `capabilities` is a required, non-optional field on every plugin tool.
 *   - An empty capability list is rejected — you cannot express "no
 *     capabilities" and thereby claim the least-dangerous class.
 *   - `gateFlagsFor` is the SINGLE translation from declared capabilities to the
 *     engine's three gate flags, and it is conservative: anything it is unsure
 *     about resolves to the MOST restrictive flag. The loader (a later stage)
 *     feeds these flags into the SAME gate maps the built-ins use, so there is
 *     exactly one authorization path, never a parallel one.
 */

// ── Capability model ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * The capabilities a plugin tool may declare. Each maps onto a concrete danger
 * the console already gates for built-ins. This is a CLOSED set: an input that
 * names anything outside it is rejected (see `isKnownCapability`), never
 * silently ignored — an unrecognized capability must fail loud, not fail open.
 *
 *   - "network"          — performs engagement egress (HTTP, DNS, any socket).
 *                          Maps to NETWORK_CAPABLE_TOOLS: forces scope approval.
 *   - "process-exec"     — spawns processes / runs commands. Also engagement
 *                          egress in practice (a spawned process can open any
 *                          socket), so it ALSO implies network-capable.
 *   - "filesystem-read"  — reads the local filesystem. Maps to LOCAL_SCOPE_TOOLS.
 *   - "filesystem-write" — writes/patches the local filesystem. Maps to
 *                          LOCAL_SCOPE_TOOLS and is never read-only.
 *   - "findings-write"   — mutates the findings store (save/update finding).
 *                          A state mutation, so never read-only.

 * uncertain resolves toward the more restrictive answer:
 *
 *   networkCapable  true if "network" OR "process-exec" is declared. A process
 *                   can open any socket, so exec implies egress. This flag feeds
 *                   NETWORK_CAPABLE_TOOLS → scope-on-demand + yolo hard-deny.
 *
 *   localScope      true if "filesystem-read" OR "filesystem-write" is declared.
 *                   Feeds LOCAL_SCOPE_TOOLS → the local-filesystem scope gate.
 *
 *   readOnly        true ONLY when the capability set is non-empty AND every
 *                   declared capability is a pure read ("filesystem-read" is the
 *                   only read capability today). network/process-exec/
 *                   filesystem-write/findings-write are all effectful, so any of
 *                   them present makes the tool NOT read-only. An EMPTY set is
 *                   never read-only — fail closed. readOnly feeds READ_ONLY_TOOLS
 *                   → the co-pilot approval exemption, so a wrong `true` here
 *                   would skip operator confirmation; that is why the rule is
 *                   "all reads" and not "any read".
 *
 * Note the asymmetry that keeps this fail-closed: capabilities this function
 * does not recognize can only ever be present in a set that ALSO fails
 * validation, but even if one slipped through, an unknown capability satisfies
 * neither the network nor the local branch (so it never grants a lighter gate)
 * and is not the read capability (so it forces readOnly to false). Unknown ⇒
 * most restrictive.

//   - "config" — carries a settings bundle (a partial TuiSettings object) to be
//                merged into a config layer. Also NO tools, NO capabilities.
//
// The security spine: a theme/config artifact must NEVER be able to reach the
