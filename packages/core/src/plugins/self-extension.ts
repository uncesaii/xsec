/**
 * Model-authored self-extension: a session-scoped, additive-only registry.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 * ------------
 * The operator asked for the DeepSeek-harness capability where the model can
 * author a plugin and register it into the running session. This module is the
 * REGISTRATION, VALIDATION and POLICY half of that, behind a setting that is
 * OFF by default (`SELF_EXTENSION_SETTING_DEF` below).
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT reproduce the flaw in that harness. In `dsh`, a
 * plugin can install a `tools/pre-execute` listener, and a listener that returns
 * without calling `next()` short-circuits the chain — so one model-written
 * plugin can silently disable the ENTIRE authorization pipeline. Their own
 * README concedes the toolset is "not a security boundary… treat it like bash
 * access." xsec's guard layer is deny-only, and that single type-level fact is
 * what lets us accept model-authored contributions without inheriting that
 * property.
 *
 * ── The contribution surface: exactly two things ─────────────────────────────
 *
 *   1. TOOL DEFINITIONS, via a `PluginManifest` with MANDATORY capabilities.
 *   2. GUARDS, as `ToolGuard` — the deny-only guard type from `guards.ts`.
 *
 * That is the whole surface. There are no hooks, no interceptors, no
 * middleware, no `next()`, no event listeners, no config mutation, no access to
 * the session, the event bus, settings, or the gate maps. Those are not
 * "discouraged" — there is no field in `ExtensionSubmission` that can carry
 * them, so they are not expressible.
 *
 * ── Why a contribution can never WIDEN access ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A contributed guard is a `ToolGuard = (ctx) => string | null | undefined`.
 * Every string is a denial reason (`evaluateGuards` treats even the empty
 * string as a placeholder denial); `null`/`undefined` is abstention. There is
 * NO value in that codomain meaning "allow". Therefore:
 *
 *   - a contributed guard cannot vote to allow;
 *   - it cannot override, cancel or short-circuit another guard's denial,
 *     because `evaluateGuards` runs every guard and only ever APPENDS reasons;
 *   - registering a contribution can only ever add guards to the evaluated set,
 *     and `allowed === reasons.length === 0`, so the verdict after registration
 *     is at most as permissive as before it.
 *
 * THIS IS THE PROPERTY `dsh` LACKS. Its pre-execute waterfall gives a plugin a
 * value ("return without calling next()") that means "stop authorizing"; ours
 * has no such value to return.
 *
 * Two runtime hardenings close the gaps the type system alone cannot:
 *
 *   - Contributed guards are wrapped (`wrapContributedGuard`). The wrapper hands
 *     the guard a FROZEN SHALLOW COPY of the `GuardContext`, never the caller's
 *     object. Without this, a contributed guard running before a built-in could
 *     mutate `ctx` (e.g. set `capabilitiesResolved = true`) and turn a built-in
 *     denial into an abstention — a real widening path, since `GuardContext`'s
 *     `readonly` markers are compile-time only. Mutating the frozen copy throws
 *     in strict mode, and `evaluateGuards` treats a throwing guard as a DENIAL,
 *     so the attempt narrows rather than widens.
 *   - The wrapper coerces the return value: a string passes through, anything
 *     else becomes `null`. A hostile object with a poisoned `toString` cannot
 *     become an allowance either way (non-strings already abstain), and this
 *     keeps the contract exact.
 *
 * ── Existing policy is untouchable ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Registration is ADDITIVE ONLY. This registry exposes no method that removes,
 * replaces, reorders or disables an existing guard, an existing gate-map entry,
 * or a built-in tool — assert that by reading the class's public surface: the
 * only mutators are `register` and the disposer it returns, and the disposer
 * only ever drops the contributions of its own registration. Base guards are
 * held in a frozen array captured at construction and are re-emitted first on
 * every `guards()` snapshot; nothing in the public API can reach them. Ordering
 * never affects `allowed` anyway (the verdict is "did anyone deny"), so
 * "reordering" is not even a meaningful attack here — but there is no API for it
 * regardless.
 *
 * A contributed tool whose name collides with a built-in is REJECTED, never
 * allowed to shadow: `reservedToolNames` is supplied by the caller (the keys of
 * `TOOL_DISPATCH` ∪ the three gate maps) and passed straight into
 * `validatePluginManifest`. Cross-extension collisions are rejected too.
 *
 * ── Capabilities: mandatory, fail-closed, one validator ───────────────────────
 *
 * This module writes NO second validator. It calls `validatePluginManifest` and
 * `gateFlagsFor` from `manifest.ts` — the same pair the third-party plugin path
 * uses — so a tool with no declared capability is rejected outright and an
 * unknown/empty capability set yields the most restrictive gate flags, never
 * read-only.
 *
 * ── OUT OF SCOPE: executing model-authored code ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * This module governs registration, validation and policy. It never compiles,
 * `eval`s, imports or invokes a tool body, and registering a tool here does NOT
 * make it callable. Execution needs the subprocess-over-stdio dispatch from
 * DESIGN.md §3 option B / stage 3. See SELF-EXTENSION.md.
 *
 * (One honest caveat, stated in full in SELF-EXTENSION.md: a contributed GUARD
 * is a function, and calling it is running code. This registry only ever accepts
 * an already-constructed function; it never turns model-authored TEXT into one.
 * The wiring must not hand it `new Function(modelText)` in-process.)
