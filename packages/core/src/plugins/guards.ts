/**
 * Monotonic, deny-only tool-authorization guards.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * xsec already authorizes tool calls through the name-keyed gates in
 * `console/turn-engine.ts` (`NETWORK_CAPABLE_TOOLS`, `LOCAL_SCOPE_TOOLS`,
 * `READ_ONLY_TOOLS`), fed by the single capability translation `gateFlagsFor`
 * in `plugins/manifest.ts`. Those gates decide, per tool NAME, whether a call
 * needs scope resolution, a local-directory prompt, or copilot approval.
 *
 * This module sits BENEATH those gates as an additional, composable floor. It
 * exists because plugins want to contribute policy, and the study of the
 * DeepSeek `dsh` harness surfaced exactly the right primitive and exactly the
 * wrong one:
 *
 *   - RIGHT: `dsh`'s `ctx.tools.guard()` is valuable because "any matching
 *     guard may deny ... no guard can force-allow a call another guard denied."
 *     That is MONOTONIC authorization: composing more guards can only ever
 *     NARROW what is permitted. Adding a plugin cannot loosen policy.
 *
 *   - WRONG: `dsh` also has a `tools/pre-execute` waterfall where a listener
 *     that returns without calling `next()` short-circuits the chain — a plugin
 *     can suppress the whole authorization pipeline. We deliberately do NOT
 *     copy that. Guards here are DENY-ONLY: there is no way to express "allow",
 *     so there is nothing to short-circuit.
 *
 * The two central properties (monotonicity + deny-only) are enforced by the
 * type system and the evaluator below, and proven by `guards.test.ts`.

// ── The deny-only guard type: why "allow" is inexpressible ────────────────────

/**
 * The context a guard inspects. Every field is a already-resolved fact about
 * the call being authorized; a guard NEVER performs I/O to discover more.
 *
 * The three capability flags mirror exactly what `gateFlagsFor` produces and
 * what the console gates consume, so a guard reasons in the same vocabulary as
 * the gates above it. `autonomyMode` and `hasScope` mirror the console's own
 * inputs to `maybeResolveScope` / `maybeApproveTool`.
 *
 * `approvalAvailable` and `capabilitiesResolved` are additions beyond the
 * gates' own inputs, justified because the built-in guards below cannot express
 * their fail-closed conditions without them (see each guard). They are typed as
 * required so a caller must decide them explicitly; the guards nonetheless read
 * them defensively (undefined is treated as the unsafe answer) so a loosely
 * typed JS caller can never widen access by omission.

/**
 * Evaluate `guards` against `ctx`. Runs EVERY guard — never short-circuits on
 * the first denial — because the operator benefits from seeing all the reasons
 * a call was blocked, and because short-circuiting is exactly the pipeline hole
 * we refuse to reproduce.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED DECISIONS (each can only NARROW, never widen):
 *   - A guard that returns any string denies (empty string → placeholder
 *     denial, so "allow" remains inexpressible even via a blank reason).
 *   - A guard that THROWS is treated as a DENIAL, with a reason naming the
 *     failure — a broken guard must never grant access.
 *   - A non-callable entry (a loosely typed caller passing garbage) is treated
 *     as a DENIAL for the same reason.
 *
 * PURITY: `ctx` and `guards` are never mutated; the function performs no I/O,
 * reads no clock, and is deterministic for a given input.
 *
 * MONOTONICITY: `allowed` is `reasons.length === 0`, and `reasons` is built by
 * appending — never removing — across guards. Extending the guard set can only
 * add reasons, so a call that was denied can never become allowed. Proven in
 * `guards.test.ts`.
 *
 * An EMPTY guard list allows (`{ allowed: true, reasons: [] }`). This is
 * CORRECT, not a hole: the guard layer is an ADDITIONAL floor beneath the
 * name-keyed gates in `turn-engine.ts`, which still run independently. An empty
 * floor simply adds no further denials; it does not remove the gates above it.

/**
 * RETIRED — kept exported for backward compatibility, but wired NOWHERE.
 *
 * ORIGINAL INTENT: deny a network-capable tool when no scope is configured, in
 * YOLO mode, mirroring an old `maybeResolveScope` hard-deny ("YOLO mode: no
 * scope configured — tool ... cannot run").
 *
 * WHY IT WAS RETIRED: the "network requires a PRECONFIGURED scope" invariant no
 * longer holds in ANY mode, so there is no mode this guard could soundly fire
 * in:
 *   - yolo is anchored to the launch TARGET, not to a scope object. A scopeless
 *     yolo call (even `bash echo hello`) is legitimate; the target anchor is
 *     enforced precisely by `maybeResolveScope` (target-relatedness) plus the
 *     executor's own same-origin/scope boundary and the absolute SSRF rail.
 *     Firing here would wrongly re-deny scopeless yolo.
 *   - standard/recon run scope-on-demand (prompt) or fall through to
 *     same-origin validation — never a blanket "needs a scope" denial.
 *   - copilot auto-expands scope to in-engagement targets; it never requires a
 *     preconfigured scope either.
 * It is therefore fully SUPERSEDED by the executor's same-origin anchoring and
 * is removed from both `BUILTIN_GUARDS` and the console's `WIRED_GUARDS`. The
 * function survives only so external callers and its own unit tests still
 * resolve; do NOT add it to any wired set.
 *
 * Its body is unchanged (a pure predicate over the context) so its existing
 * unit tests stay coherent — retirement is about WIRING, not behaviour.
