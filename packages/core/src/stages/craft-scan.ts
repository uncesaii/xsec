/**
 * Craft scan stage — the agentic "reason about a described bug, then craft a
 * triggering input" path. This is the userspace sibling of the memory-safety
 * FUZZ path (`memsafety-scan.ts`): instead of compiling + fuzzing a harness
 * (which needs the target built), the agent reads the pre-patch source with
 * read-only tools and crafts a minimal PoC input file, testing each candidate
 * against an INJECTED oracle and refining from its output.
 *
 * Why injected oracle: the "did this input trigger the bug?" signal is
 * environment-specific. For a benchmark (CyberGym) it's the differential
 * submission oracle; for a real target it's a local build+run-under-sanitizer
 * executor. The stage stays generic — the caller supplies `evaluatePoc`.
 *
 * Discipline (load-bearing, mirrors memsafety-scan.ts):
 *   - **Never self-grade.** The verdict is the injected oracle's. A candidate is
 *     only a confirmed PoC when `evaluatePoc` reports it triggered (and, when a
 *     differential is available, that it's patch-specific).
 *   - **Honest negatives.** No oracle confirmation → zero findings + a warning,
 *     never a fabricated crash.
 *   - **Read-only exploration.** The file tools are sandboxed to `sourceRoot`.
 *     This stage writes only the candidate PoC under a temp path and submits /
 *     discloses nothing itself.
