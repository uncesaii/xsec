/**
 * Hunt evidence ledger — the shared, append-only claim store for a hunt
 * campaign.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes (measured, not speculative)
 *
 * `runHuntScan` fans finders and skeptics out across a `pool` (hunt-scan.ts
 * :366) and each `agenticScan` gets its OWN throwaway SQLite file
 * (`freshHuntDb`, hunt-scan.ts:63) precisely so concurrent workers never
 * contend on a write lock. That decision is correct and this module does not
 * touch it. But it means workers share NOTHING at runtime: they hand findings
 * back to the parent and that is the entire channel.
 *
 * The learned-negatives loop (hunt-negatives.ts) is the closest thing to shared
 * memory, and it is strictly END-OF-RUN: `@xsec/benchmark`'s `appendToCorpus`
 * writes `HuntFindingRecord[]` after `runHuntScan` has already returned, and
 * `loadKnownNegativesFromEnv()` reads that corpus ONCE, when the skeptic
 * verifier is constructed. So when worker A refutes a shape at minute 2 of a
 * 40-minute sweep, workers B..N re-derive that refutation from scratch for the
 * remaining 38 minutes, and a second hunt PROCESS running the same campaign
 * never sees it at all. That is the concrete waste this module removes.
 *
 * ## Shape, and why each field exists
 *
 * A claim carries its supporting evidence, its dependencies, and a status of
 * `unresolved | validated | disproven`. Two properties are load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. **Observations are distinguishable from assumptions.** Every evidence
 *     entry declares a {@link EvidenceStance}. This is not a decorative label:
 *     an `observation` MUST carry a `locator` (a `file:line`, a tool name, a
 *     command) so it can be re-checked by another worker, and a claim may NOT
 *     reach a terminal status (`validated` / `disproven`) on assumptions alone
 *     — see {@link validateClaimBody}. Without that rule, "distinguishable"
 *     degrades to a field nobody fills in honestly, and a swarm cheerfully
 *     buries a dead end under three layers of confident inference.
 *
 *  2. **Negative results stay available.** A `disproven` claim is a first-class
 *     record, not an absence. {@link disprovenHuntClaims} is what a later
 *     worker reads so it does not re-walk the dead end;
 *     `loadKnownNegativesFromLedger` (hunt-negatives.ts) adapts those records
 *     into the EXISTING `KnownNegative` shape so the skeptic prompt path is
 *     unchanged — this integrates with the learned-negatives gate rather than
 *     forking a second one.
 *
 * ## Why append-only JSONL and not SQLite (and not `proposal-replay.ts`)
 *
 * SQLite is off the table by the same reasoning that produced `freshHuntDb`:
 * one shared DB across a fan-out is exactly the write-lock contention that
 * crashed verify steps mid-sweep. A single-writer parent-owned store would
 * work for the in-process `pool`, but not for the case that actually costs us
 * — two hunt PROCESSES on one campaign — and it would put the parent on the
 * critical path of every worker's write.
 *
 * So: append-only JSONL, one record per line, written with a single
 * `O_APPEND|O_CREAT|O_NOFOLLOW` write. That is the mechanism
 * `research/proposal-replay.ts:328` already uses and it is reused here
 * deliberately — as is its canonical-JSON + content-addressed-id discipline
 * (`canonicalProposalJson` / `proposalDigest`, imported below rather than
 * reimplemented). O_APPEND makes each worker's write land at the current end
 * of file without a seek race, and one write syscall per small record means
 * concurrent writers cannot byte-interleave a record.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT reused is `proposal-replay.ts`'s SCHEMA and its
 * write path, for three reasons that are specific and checkable:
 *
 *  - `createProposalAttempt` demands a `ResearchProposal`, which demands
 *    citations with `excerptSha256` digests computed against a
 *    `TargetSourceSnapshot` of full file contents (research/proposal.ts). A
 *    hunt claim has a finder's prose and a `file:line` that may not even
 *    resolve. Building a verified snapshot per claim mid-sweep is not
 *    affordable and often not possible.
 *  - Its outcome rules (proposal-replay.ts:156-164) require `refuted` to carry
 *    deterministic truth evidence (`deterministic_oracle|sanitizer|reproducer`)
 *    from an INDEPENDENT producer plus an adequate coverage receipt. The hunt
 *    skeptic's refutation is a `model_report`. The single most valuable thing
 *    to persist here is therefore the one thing that store refuses to record —
 *    and relaxing the rule is not an option, because those labels feed
 *    `proposalTrainingExamples` → `proposal-ranker.ts:70`. Loosening the bar to
 *    fit hunt evidence would poison an ML label set.
 *  - `appendProposalAttempt` re-reads and re-validates the ENTIRE replay before
 *    every append (proposal-replay.ts:330). That is fine for a single-writer
 *    research loop and wrong here twice over: it is O(n^2) across a campaign,
 *    and across processes the read-then-append window is racy anyway, so it
 *    buys no real exclusion.
 *
 * The consequence of dropping that read-before-write is that duplicate
 * suppression moves to READ time. Records are content-addressed
 * ({@link HuntClaimRecord.id}), so re-running identical work produces a
 * byte-identical record and {@link readHuntLedger} collapses it. That is the
 * deliberate trade: idempotence as a read-time property, because a write-time
 * check cannot be made race-free across processes without a lock, and a lock is
 * precisely what the per-worker-SQLite decision exists to avoid.
