/**
 * recency-hunt — the RECENCY FLYWHEEL orchestration stage.
 *
 * The hard-won thesis this encodes: the frozen kernelCTF-LTS snapshot is TAPPED
 * because it is a *hardened* snapshot — syzkaller + the top exploit groups have
 * already swept it. Bugs live in the RECENCY WINDOW: just-committed code, in the
 * days before that same machinery hardens it. The only structure that beats the
 * audit-density wall is one that continuously hunts the freshness window.
 *
 * Pipeline (each arrow narrows the funnel — most commits SHOULD filter out):
 *
 *   git diff <range> on the kernel tree
 *        │  changed files + hunks
 *        ▼
 *   REACHABILITY filter  ({@link isReachablePath})  ── drop HW drivers, arch/,
 *        │                 tools/, docs, CAP-gated-only paths. Keep unpriv-
 *        │                 reachable, kernelCTF-eligible-ish subsystems.
 *        ▼
 *   SEMANTIC-vs-COSMETIC classifier  ({@link classifySemanticVsCosmetic})
 *        │  The KEY filter. A diff that renames / reformats / reshapes control
 *        │  flow AROUND UNCHANGED get/put/lock/free/alloc logic is COSMETIC → skip.
 *        │  A diff that ADDS / REMOVES / REORDERS a get/put/lock/free/alloc, or
 *        │  changes a refcount/lifetime field's handling, is SEMANTIC → hunt.
 *        │  (Deterministic {@link lifetimeTokenSignal} pre-computes the signal;
 *        │   the LLM is the authority and gets that signal as a hint.)
 *        ▼
 *   REFINED ENGINE on the semantic-changed files — ALL THREE detectors share ONE
 *        │  invariant model (built once per file) and feed the SAME adversarial gate:
 *        │   • dataflow — {@link runSubsystemInvariantHunt}: buildInvariantModel →
 *        │     findViolationsDataflow (intra-proc lock-set + reaching-free) → gate.
 *        │   • refcount — {@link findInterprocRefcountCouplings}: call-graph-aware
 *        │     get/put coupling; keeps `leak-suspect` (non-balanced) couplings. A
 *        │     fresh commit can add a CROSS-FILE refcount leak the intra-proc path
 *        │     structurally cannot see.
 *        │   • race — {@link findRaceCandidates}: cross-function lockset-inconsistency
 *        │     with interproc lock propagation; keeps high-severity write-bearing
 *        │     candidates. A fresh commit can add a CROSS-THREAD race, not just an
 *        │     intra-proc lifetime bug.
 *        │  Each candidate is tagged with its detector; all flow through the same
 *        │  runHuntScan skeptic gate. Detector selection is configurable (default all).
 *        ▼
 *   ADVERSARIAL VERIFY (the skeptic gate, assume-FP) → confirmed, ranked
 *        │
 *        ▼
 *   RANKED REPORT (JSON + markdown): funnel counts, per-file verdicts,
 *   high-confidence survivors flagged + shaped as an autoclimb bug-spec.
 *
 * WHY the vsock MSG_ZEROCOPY lead was FALSE (encoded here): that "rewrite" only
 * reshaped branch layout ON TOP OF an already-landed refcount fix — no
 * reintroduction. So the filter signal is a SEMANTIC lifetime-logic change, NOT
 * "the file was rewritten." {@link lifetimeTokenSignal} is exactly that
 * discriminator: identical get/put/lock multiset across +/- lines ⇒ cosmetic.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE: a survivor is a LEAD worth weaponizing, not a proven 0-day. The
 * skeptic gate refutes over-approximation FPs but does not PROVE; novelty (is it
 * already patched later in the same window?) and real reachability are the
 * downstream gates the operator runs before any disclosure. NOTHING here sends.

of a lifetime/refcount/lock bug hunt. Be strict: the whole value of this filter is
that MOST diffs are COSMETIC and correctly skipped.

Classify SEMANTIC when the diff does ANY of:
  - ADDS, REMOVES, or REORDERS a get/put/hold/release, lock/unlock, alloc/free,
    or rcu-publish/deref call.
  - Changes which lock guards a field, or the order two locks are taken.
  - Changes how a refcount / lifetime field is incremented, decremented, tested,
    or the condition under which an object is freed.
  - Moves a free/put earlier or later relative to a use of the same object.
  - Changes an error/cleanup path so an object is (or is not) released on a branch
    it previously was (or was not).

Classify COSMETIC when the diff ONLY does things like:
  - Rename a variable / function / struct field with no change to lifetime calls.
  - Reformat, rewrap, reindent, or re-comment.
  - Reshape control flow (early-return, goto→if, split a helper) AROUND UNCHANGED
    get/put/lock/free logic — the SAME lifetime operations run in the SAME order
    on the SAME objects. THIS IS THE KEY TRAP: a "rewrite" that only reshuffles
    branch layout on top of already-correct lifetime code is COSMETIC. Do not be
    fooled by diff size.
  - Pure additions of unrelated features that touch no shared object's lifetime.

If the lifetime operations present are IDENTICAL before and after (same multiset,
same objects), it is COSMETIC even if the code looks heavily rewritten.
