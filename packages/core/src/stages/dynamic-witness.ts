/**
 * DYNAMIC WITNESS — v3 of the assumption-mining hunter, and the piece the whole
 * field structurally lacks: the DYNAMIC ORACLE for dual-view / cross-phase
 * assumption candidates.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. v0-v2 mine relied-on assumptions, enumerate dual-view /
 * cross-phase seams (one long-lived object reached by two distinct entries/phases
 * where the second does not re-establish the first's guarantee), and hand every
 * survivor to the STATIC skeptic gate. v2's bench run proved the honest ceiling:
 * the static skeptic REFUTES all dual-view candidates. That is EXPECTED — a
 * dual-view/cross-phase bug is an INSTANCE problem (do the two phases touch the
 * SAME object concurrently / after the guarantee is dropped?), and no static,
 * name-based analysis can judge instance aliasing across two call-trees. The
 * candidate is neither confirmable nor refutable on paper.
 *
 * So the arbiter has to be DYNAMIC. This module takes a dual-view candidate and:
 *   1. SYNTHESIZES an unprivileged C PoC (LLM) that drives the two-view violation
 *      sequence — entry A establishes the assumed state, entry B violates it,
 *      then the dereference/use that would fault is triggered.
 *   2. BOOTS it in a KASAN VM (reusing the existing kernel-VM harness —
 *      {@link runReproducerInKernelVm} / the busybox-initramfs lane), capturing
 *      serial + dmesg.
 *   3. WITNESSES honestly: promote to CONFIRMED **only** when a real KASAN splat
 *      fires AND is BOUND to the candidate's object/site (the faulting function or
 *      the alloc/free stack references the candidate's object or one of its
 *      entries) — not an incidental splat, and never a splat the PoC itself
 *      printed (the anti-fabrication guard). No splat → refuted. Never compiled →
 *      inconclusive.
 *   4. ITERATES: feed the boot output back to the LLM to fix the PoC across a
 *      bounded budget — a PoC is usually wrong before it is right (AEG is hard).
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE. This is assume-FP by construction: the default verdict is
 * refuted/inconclusive; CONFIRMED requires an object-bound kernel splat from a run
 * the PoC did not fabricate. PoC synthesis is AEG-hard — compile rate < 1, and a
 * compiling PoC that actually drives the race/UAF is rarer still — so the realistic
 * hit-rate on HEAVILY-audited surfaces (net/unix SCM_RIGHTS, where DirtyCred lives)
 * is ~0 new bugs. The payoff is (a) MECHANISM: a synthesize→boot→witness loop that
 * runs end-to-end and cannot fabricate a crash, and (b) LEVERAGE: pointed at
 * FRESH / under-audited cross-phase objects, the same oracle turns an unjudgeable
 * static candidate into a real dynamic verdict.
