/**
 * Hunt scan stage — xsec's parallel NOVEL-BUG discovery loop, as a first-class
 * engine stage (sibling of runCraftScan / runExploitScan).
 *
 * Benchmarks reproduce KNOWN bugs; this finds UNKNOWN ones. It codifies the
 * discovery architecture that has actually produced 0-days for us (the TIPC
 * incomplete-fix variant hunt) instead of doing it ad-hoc via subagents:
 *
 *   candidates ──fan out (parallel)──> FINDER (agenticScan, per candidate)
 *                                          │  findings
 *                                          ▼
 *                                   SKEPTIC + PROVER (injected `verify`)
 *                                          │  confirmed, novel, reachable
 *                                          ▼
 *                                     HuntScanResult.confirmed
 *
 * Four levers, made concrete:
 *  - PARALLELIZATION (coverage): fan finders out over many candidates at once.
 *  - FRESHNESS (the proven edge): caller points `candidates` at under-audited
 *    surface (new drivers / linux-next) or VARIANT sites of a recent fix.
 *  - MODEL DIVERSITY: pass several `models`; each candidate is hunted by each,
 *    findings unioned — different models surface different bugs.
 *  - THE ORACLE (no self-grading): `verify` is the skeptic+prover gate (assume-FP
 *    refute → build+run+sanitizer reproduce). Injected, so prod wires the real
 *    verify pipeline and this stage stays generic.
 *
 * Reuses the finder (`agenticScan`) verbatim; the new part is the fan-out +
 * candidate model + the verify gate.

//   1. HUNT_FINDER_TIMEOUT_MS — a hard wall-clock cap per finder call.
//      `agenticScan` has no cancellation signal in its option surface, so on

//      old effectively-infinite wait was the bug, not a feature. Set very
//      high (or a non-positive/non-numeric value) to approximate the old
//      "wait forever" behavior.
//   2. HUNT_FINDER_MAX_RETRIES — bounded retries when the finder call
//      REJECTS with a transient-looking error (fetch failed / 429 / 5xx /
//      timeout-ish). Backoff between attempts; after the budget is spent the
//      candidate is recorded `errored` and skipped. Never infinite — we've
