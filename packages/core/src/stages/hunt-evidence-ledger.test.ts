/**
 * Hunt evidence ledger (hunt-evidence-ledger.ts) + its bridge into the existing
 * learned-negatives gate (hunt-negatives.ts). Coverage:
 *
 *   - CONCURRENCY: two REAL OS processes appending to one ledger at the same
 *     time lose nothing and tear nothing. Run through actual child processes
 *     rather than `Promise.all` in one process, because `writeFileSync` is
 *     synchronous — an in-process "concurrent" test would serialise itself and
 *     prove nothing about the O_APPEND claim in the module header.
 *   - SHARING: a claim one worker disproves is visible to a second worker, and
 *     reaches the skeptic through the pre-existing `KnownNegative` path.
 *   - STANCE: observations and assumptions stay distinguishable end-to-end, an
 *     observation without a locator is refused, and a terminal status cannot be
 *     reached on assumptions alone.
 *   - APPEND-ONLY / IDEMPOTENCE: history is retained across a status
 *     transition, and re-running identical work does not duplicate the claim.
