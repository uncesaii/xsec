/**
 * npm-ecosystem dynamic-discovery — the extensible **Detector** contract.
 *
 * This is the durable enabler behind the operator's "self-extending flywheel"
 * requirement: every future confirmed novel bug class (from ANY method) should
 * be able to become a new Detector that runs at ecosystem scale, automatically.
 * A Detector is a small, self-contained plugin registered in
 * {@link ./registry.ts DETECTOR_REGISTRY}; the stage
 * (`../npm-dynamic-discovery.ts`) drives it, and the shared discipline
 * (assume-FP + dedup + downloads-floor / freshness) lives in `./base.ts` so
 * every detector inherits it — you cannot register a detector that skips it.
 *
 * The recipe for deriving a new Detector from a confirmed finding + its PoC is
 * `docs/operations/detector-from-finding.md`.
 *
 * Design invariants (load-bearing, not decoration):
 *   - **Deterministic confirm.** `confirm()` may run untrusted package code in
 *     an isolated env, but the *verdict* is computed from an OBSERVED runtime
 *     consequence (a prototype actually polluted, a validator actually bypassed,
 *     a socket target that actually diverges). LLM proposal is allowed ONLY in
 *     `identifyCandidates` (candidate shape ranking / expansion) and is never
 *     load-bearing for a confirmation. Assume-FP everywhere else.
 *   - **One finding shape.** A confirmation is promoted to the canonical
 *     `Finding` by the stage, so every existing renderer / sink / DB / verify /
 *     disclosure path works unchanged. No parallel finding type.
