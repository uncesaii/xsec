/**
 * Shared novelty gate for npm dynamic-discovery. Baked into `base.ts` so EVERY
 * detector inherits it — a confirmed pollution/bypass/divergence is only
 * eligible for disclosure when it is `novel && confirmed`.
 *
 * Three layers, cheapest first (the exact lesson the sspp prototype encoded
 * after `npm audit` alone missed the `radash` fork-twin of CVE-2025-48054):
 *   1. **prior-report** — packages xsec already filed for this class.
 *   2. **fork-cve-twin** — packages whose vulnerable code is identical to a
 *      sibling/fork carrying a PUBLIC advisory but with NO advisory under their
 *      own npm name (so a live advisory DB gives a false all-clear).
 *   3. **live advisory lookup** — OSV / npm advisory DB, injected as a seam
 *      (`AdvisoryLookup`) so the pure dedup logic stays deterministic and
 *      testable. When no lookup is wired we do NOT claim novelty blindly: the
 *      verdict is `novel` with `source: "unknown"` recorded, signalling the
 *      online check was skipped (the promotion gate treats that as
 *      possibly-known, mirroring the engine's `noveltyVerdict` semantics).

 * injectable is what lets the confirm+dedup path be exercised hermetically.
