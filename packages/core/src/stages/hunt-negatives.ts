/**
 * Learned negatives — a known-refuted-shape memory for the hunt skeptic gate.
 *
 * `makeSkepticVerifier` (hunt-scan.ts) already re-reads a claimed finding and
 * tries hard to refute it. What it doesn't have is memory: if the SAME shape
 * (a debug-gated driver "bug" that's dead code, an already-CVE'd path) was
 * refuted last run, this run's skeptic re-derives that from scratch every
 * time. This module derives a `known-negatives` set from the hunt-variant
 * corpus (`@xsec/benchmark`'s `hunt-variant-v1.jsonl`, read by PATH — core
 * must not depend on `@xsec/benchmark`) — rows where the skeptic+prover gate
 * already returned `skepticConfirmed === false` — and, when a new finding
 * matches one closely enough, attaches that prior reason as CONTEXT to the
 * skeptic's prompt.
 *
 * Mirrors xverse's `oracle.suspected_known()` discipline (labels, never
 * auto-dismisses): a match is a NOTE the skeptic reads, not a rejection. The
 * skeptic call still runs, still decides, and can still confirm a finding
 * that matches a known-negative shape if a new distinguishing fact overrides
 * it. This module never returns a verdict and never drops a finding on its
 * own — see `matchNegative`'s docstring.
 *
 * Reuses `hunt-flywheel.ts`'s token vocabulary (`classTokens` / `jaccard` /
 * `memoryTokens` / `loadHuntCorpusRows`) so a "known-negative shape" and a
 * "primed memory shape" are scored by the exact same join key — one
 * similarity vocabulary for the whole flywheel + learned-negatives pair, not
 * two independently-drifting ones.

 * actually supplies a corpus of known negatives (`opts.negatives` /
 * {@link loadKnownNegativesFromEnv}), so the default-ON blast radius on a
 * deployment with no corpus is exactly zero. Set `XSEC_HUNT_NEGATIVES=0` to
 * pin the old behaviour for an ablation.
 *
 * The residual risk is ANCHORING — a skeptic told "this shape was refuted
 * before" rubber-stamping the refutation of a genuinely new bug. Three things
 * bound it: the context is explicitly labelled as overridable (see
 * {@link negativeContext}), only the single BEST match is ever attached, and the
 * prior reason is truncated ({@link MAX_NEGATIVE_REASON_CHARS}) so it can never
