/**
 * Race-widening smell-hunter candidate generation — xsec's kernelCTF Pipeline #3.
 *
 * A sibling of `generateVariantCandidates` (variant-candidates.ts) and
 * `generateInvariantCandidates` (invariant-candidates.ts). This hunts the ONE
 * static smell behind the LPE-grade races that are currently winning real
 * kernelCTF money (ExpRace, Calif's "race within a race", CVE-2025-38617 which
 * beat SLAB_VIRTUAL + RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES): a "nanosecond" window that a
 * winner WIDENS into controllable seconds.
 *
 * The smell, stated as code shape:
 *
 *     unlock(A) ─▶ [ sleep / mutex_lock / GFP_KERNEL alloc / copy_from_user ] ─▶ lock(B)
 *                                    ▲
 *                     attacker-influenced state read/written across the gap
 *
 * The key insight the winners exploit: between dropping lock A and taking the
 * next (SLEEPABLE) lock B — or doing any sleeping op (a mutex, a GFP_KERNEL
 * allocation that can block on reclaim, a copy_from_user that can fault) — the
 * scheduler can preempt, so the window is not really "nanoseconds". If attacker
 * state is consulted across that gap, the attacker races a second thread in and
 * WIDENS the window (mdelay/kprobe on the sleep point, userfaultfd/FUSE stalls
 * on the copy) from ns to 10-118s of controllable time (ExpRace made 10/10
 * races reliable). "Conditional logic near locks is a smell."
 *
 *   subsystem source ──LLM──▶ RaceSmellCandidate[] {lock_a, sleep_point, lock_b,
 *                                   │                 attacker_state, widen_hint,
 *                                   │                 hypothesized_primitive}
 *                                   ▼ map to sites + prover knobs
 *                       runHuntScan(brief, candidates)   ── and ──▶ kernel-vm-runner
 *                                                             race-widening kprobe
 *
 * Same shape/interface as its siblings (returns a `brief` + `HuntCandidate[]`)
 * so it drops straight into `runHuntScan`; it additionally returns the rich
 * smell candidates, and — the new part — a `widenEnv` per candidate that maps
 * the `widen_hint` onto the existing `XSEC_KERNEL_QEMU_WIDEN_*` prover knobs
 * (kernel-vm-runner.ts), i.e. WHERE to inject the `mdelay()` kprobe to widen
 * THIS specific window.
 *
 * The LLM does the one thing a grep can't: read a lock/sleep/lock sequence and
 * reason about whether attacker state is consulted across the sleeping gap. It
 * is a HYPOTHESIS generator — every candidate still goes through the
 * skeptic+prover gate in `runHuntScan` (and a real widened race repro) before it
 * is believed. No self-grading here.
