/**
 * Cross-family adversarial refuter — decorrelate finder and refuter errors
 * (issue #661).
 *
 * `makeSkepticVerifier` (hunt-scan.ts) re-reads a claimed finding and tries hard
 * to REFUTE it (assume-FP). By default that refute pass runs through the same
 * provider-agnostic loop — typically the same model FAMILY that produced the
 * finding, and in the CLI hunt path (`hunt.ts`, which hands the skeptic
 * `models[0]`) literally the SAME MODEL. A model is worst at catching its own
 * systematic errors: same blind spots, same hallucinated sinks, so correlated
 * errors survive. An adversarial gate whose adversary shares the finder's priors
 * is not an adversarial gate; it is a second opinion from the same witness.
 *
 * This module forces the refute pass onto a model of a DIFFERENT family than the
 * finder before a finding can be promoted. The errors decorrelate — a
 * hallucinated or non-reproducible finding gets caught by the second family, and
 * the ones that survive two families are genuinely disclosure-grade.
 *
 * ON by default (see {@link crossFamilyRefuteEnabled}) because every path out of
 * this module degrades to today's exact behaviour when a second family is not
 * actually reachable:
 *
 *   - Only one provider configured → the roster has at most one family, it
 *     equals the finder's, and {@link selectCrossFamilyRefuter} returns the
 *     configured refuter UNCHANGED (status `no-distinct-family`). No error, no
 *     skipped refutation — the same-family skeptic still runs, exactly as before.
 *   - Finder family unknown (no `models` passed, provider default in play) →
 *     passthrough, status `unknown-finder-family`. There is nothing to
 *     decorrelate FROM, so guessing would be worse than not trying.
 *   - The cross-family model is configured but the CALL fails (model id not
 *     enabled on the account, provider outage) → hunt-scan.ts retries the refute
 *     once on the ORIGINAL model and records status `degraded-refuter-error`.
 *     This matters: a throwing verifier is treated as fail-closed upstream
 *     (`runHuntScan` records a warning and drops the finding;
 *     `makeMultiLensVerifier` counts the lens as errored, lowering the survivor
 *     count), so without the retry a bad roster entry would silently DELETE real
 *     findings. Degrading to the same-family refuter loses decorrelation; it
 *     never loses the gate.
 *
 * Falling back to the same-family refuter rather than dropping the finding is
 * the assume-FP-safe choice throughout: a finding is never promoted on LESS
 * scrutiny than today, and never dropped for an infrastructure reason.
 *
 * {@link selectCrossFamilyRefuter} is a PURE selector (no LLM calls, no env, no
 * I/O) so the promotion gate stays unit-testable; the env-reading helpers
 * ({@link crossFamilyRefuteEnabled}, {@link availableRefuterCandidates}) sit
 * beside it and are applied by the wiring layer in hunt-scan.ts.

 * regardless. It adds no extra LLM call — the refute pass runs either way — and
 * every failure mode degrades to the pre-existing same-family behaviour (see the

 * ZAI_DEFAULT_MODEL / KIMI_DEFAULT_MODEL); they are duplicated rather than
 * imported so this module keeps its `@xsec/shared`-only dependency and stays
 * trivially unit-testable. `envKeys` are the auth vars `providerForModel`
 * (llm-api.ts) actually checks before it will route a model to that provider —
 * listing a family whose auth is absent would produce a refuter that cannot be
 * called.
 *
 * Ordered strongest-adversary-first: the refute pass is a careful re-read of
 * source, so a weak model in this slot buys decorrelation at the cost of rigour.
 *
 * Deliberately EXCLUDED:
 *   - google/gemini — `providerForModel` has no Google branch, so a Gemini id
 *     cannot be routed today no matter which key is set.
 *   - openrouter — a meta-router; the key alone does not say which family you
 *     get. Operators who want it can name explicit `openrouter/<vendor>/<model>`
 *     ids via XSEC_HUNT_REFUTER_CANDIDATES, which {@link refuterFamily}
 *     classifies correctly.
 *   - AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY — same family as OpenAI (so it buys no
 *     decorrelation against a GPT finder), and Azure addresses models by
 *     account-specific DEPLOYMENT name, which we cannot guess. Operators with
 *     an Azure-only OpenAI path should name their deployment explicitly via
 *     XSEC_HUNT_REFUTER_CANDIDATES.
