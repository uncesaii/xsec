/**
 * Second-audit stage — the "treat every crash as SHALLOW-by-default" step.
 *
 * This is the winner move that separates an $82k kernelCTF-class submission from
 * a first-order crash report. A raw crash / KASAN report / candidate almost
 * always names a SYMPTOM (the sink that faulted), not the ROOT. The people who
 * win do a second audit BEFORE they burn a verify budget:
 *
 *   1. Is the obvious root-cause the REAL bug, or a shallow symptom of a deeper
 *      one? (e.g. a UAF read that faults is a symptom; the deeper bug is the
 *      lifetime/refcount rule that let the object die early — fixing the read
 *      site leaves the deeper bug live and re-triggerable elsewhere.)
 *   2. If there is already an upstream fix for the obvious bug, is that fix
 *      COMPLETE or BYPASSABLE? A patch that guards ONE call-site / ONE
 *      precondition frequently misses a sibling path — the highest-EV variant.
 *   3. Emit a REFINED candidate: {deeper_root_cause, fix_bypass_hypothesis,
 *      confidence} — or "first-order is the real bug" when the audit confirms
 *      the obvious cause is genuinely the root and any fix is complete.
 *
 * It sits in front of the skeptic+prover gate as a candidate-REFINEMENT step:
 * DEEPEN first, then verify. It does not itself confirm anything (it is a model
 * reading code, so it only proposes) — the refined candidate is what the gate
 * then tries to reproduce.
 *
 * The LLM is INJECTED (a `SecondAuditModel`) so prod wires the real engine
 * runtime (LlmApiRuntime) and tests stub it with a fake — no network, no keys.
