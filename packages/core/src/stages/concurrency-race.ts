/**
 * Concurrency-aware analysis — a cross-function shared-field LOCKSET-INCONSISTENCY
 * race-CANDIDATE generator. xsec's first increment of concurrency awareness.
 *
 * NOISE CONTROL (why the output is prover-feedable, not a dump): the raw
 * lockset-inconsistency signal is dominated by benign FP classes, so bounded
 * refinements run before a candidate is emitted (measured on the fs/locks + net/unix
 * + ipc/mqueue + posix-timers + fs/notify + ipc/shm sweep):
 *   REFINEMENT 0 (INTERPROCEDURAL LOCK PROPAGATION) — the #1 FP class: a helper
 *     that never takes a lock ITSELF but is only ever CALLED while a caller holds one
 *     (mqueue `__do_notify`/`remove_notification` under `info->lock`, the net/unix GC
 *     leaf helpers under `unix_gc_lock`, `exit_itimers`) looks "unlocked" and gets
 *     flagged. A lightweight subsystem call graph folds the locks a function ALWAYS
 *     runs under (held by ALL its call-sites, MUST-intersection, iterated to a bounded
 *     fixpoint) into that function's field accesses, so the touch is no longer
 *     unlocked and the candidate is suppressed. Callers that DISAGREE propagate
 *     nothing — the candidate is kept (real signal). See {@link computePropagatedLocks}.
 *   FILTER 1 — suppress init/teardown/getter functions on the UNLOCKED side. A field
 *     touched only-unlocked inside a constructor/copy/dumper (`flock_make_lock`,
 *     `lease_init`, `*_alloc`, `lock_get_status`, `*_show`, `shmem_fill_super`, …) is
 *     single-threaded pre-publication or a read-only dump, not a race. See
 *     {@link isSuppressedInconsistentFn}.
 *   FILTER 2 — require a WRITE somewhere in the racing pair. An all-reads-vs-reads
 *     "race" on a lifetime field cannot corrupt memory. To keep this from killing the
 *     REAL list-linkage races (`flc_blocked_requests`/`flc_blocked_member`), a
 *     `&x->field` passed to a list/hlist MUTATOR ({@link LIST_MUTATORS}) counts as a
 *     write to that field.
 * Both are name/AST heuristics with documented misses (see each site). On mm/shmem.c
 * discovery this cut candidates 33→17 (6 init/getter + 7 reads-only removed); the
 * high-value `flc_blocker`/`flc_blocked_requests` cancel-vs-wake candidates survive.
 *
 * WHY this exists (the gap it closes): the seedless invariant checker
 * ({@link ./c-dataflow.ts}, {@link ./subsystem-invariant-model.ts}) is
 * INTRA-procedural and SINGLE-threaded by construction — it reasons about one
 * function, one path, one thread of control. It literally cannot see the bug class
 * that dominates what survives on the hardened, eligible kernel surface: a field
 * mutated by one thread while another thread reads/frees it, because the two
 * accesses live in DIFFERENT functions reachable from independent entry points
 * (two syscalls, a syscall vs. a work/timer/softirq). The intra-proc engine, asked
 * "is this one access correctly locked?", answers "yes" for BOTH sites and never
 * relates them. This module relates them.
 *
 *   subsystem source ──▶ per-function structured MUST lock-set over every access to
 *                        a shared field ──▶ CROSS-FUNCTION Eraser-style consistency
 *                        check ──▶ RaceCandidate[]  (field guarded by L in fn A but
 *                        touched with no lock / a different lock in independently
 *                        reachable fn B) ──▶ HuntCandidate[] for runHuntScan
 *
 * WHAT it computes (the lock-set idea from c-dataflow, lifted cross-function):
 *   1. For each shared field of a modeled object (its lifetime / refcount / state
 *      fields), find EVERY access across ALL functions in the subsystem, and the
 *      set of locks held AT that access (a structured must-analysis over the
 *      function AST — reuses the acquire/release vocabulary and the receiver+field
 *      lock canonicalization from c-dataflow, and additionally sees accessor-macro
 *      accesses `READ_ONCE`/`WRITE_ONCE`/`smp_load_acquire`/`smp_store_release`,
 *      which the intra-proc UAF event stream intentionally skips).
 *   2. Apply the Eraser lockset-refinement idea ACROSS functions: a field that is
 *      accessed while holding lock L in some function(s) but with NO lock (or a
 *      DISJOINT lock) in another, independently reachable function is flagged as a
 *      "possible concurrent access with inconsistent locking" candidate.
 *   3. Prioritize fields whose torn state is a lifetime/refcount pointer (a race on
 *      `->blocker`/`->transport`/`->notify_sock`/a refcount = potential UAF);
 *      de-prioritize pure stat counters.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE — read before trusting a candidate. This is a race SMELL detector,
 * NOT a proven data race:
 *   - It finds LOCKSET INCONSISTENCY, which is *necessary* but not *sufficient* for
 *     a race. There is NO happens-before analysis and NO interleaving proof. A field
 *     deliberately accessed locklessly with acquire/release memory ordering (exactly
 *     how `fs/locks.c` handles `flc_blocker`) is CORRECT but WILL be flagged. That is
 *     a false positive by construction, and the honest output is "candidate", not
 *     "bug".
 *   - "Independently reachable" is approximated as "different function". REFINEMENT 0
 *     (interprocedural lock propagation) now suppresses the common case where the two
 *     functions share a caller that holds the lock across the call; what remains is a
 *     bounded, documented residue — a callee reached only through a function pointer
 *     (invisible edge), or an EXPORTED function with unknown external callers, is
 *     conservatively treated as a real entry point and still flagged.
 *   - Fields are keyed by NAME (no points-to / no type resolution): a `->state` on
 *     two unrelated structs is unified. Locks are compared by lock-FIELD identity
 *     (receiver-stripped) to blunt the reciprocal aliasing problem, but it remains a
 *     heuristic.
 *   - The two noise filters (above) are name/AST heuristics, so they under- AND
 *     over-fire: a constructor NOT matching the name patterns (e.g. `__shmem_get_inode`,
 *     which allocates but is named `_get_`) leaks a pre-publication write FP through
 *     FILTER 1; conversely a genuinely-concurrent function named like a getter would be
 *     wrongly suppressed. FILTER 2's write requirement drops an all-reads race, which is
 *     benign for UAF but could hide a torn-read-only correctness bug.
 * Race analysis is famously imprecise; treat every candidate as a lead for the
 * downstream skeptic+prover gate (and a real racing repro), never as a finding.

// ── Interprocedural (call-graph) lock propagation ───────────────────────────────
//
// THE REFINEMENT. The dominant FP the intra-procedural lock-set emits is the
// callee-under-caller's-lock case: a helper (`__do_notify`, `remove_notification`,
// the net/unix GC leaf helpers, `exit_itimers`) that never acquires a lock ITSELF
// but is only ever reached while a caller holds one, so its field touches look
// "unlocked" and get flagged against the properly-locked accesses elsewhere.
//
// FIX: over the subsystem call graph, compute for each DEFINED function the set of
// lock identities held at EVERY one of its in-subsystem call-sites (a MUST /
// intersection analysis). If that set is non-empty, the function always runs under
// those locks, so they are folded into the lock-set of its field accesses — the
// touch is no longer "unlocked" and the benign candidate is suppressed. If callers
// DISAGREE (one holds L, another doesn't) the intersection is empty and nothing is
// propagated, so the candidate is KEPT (that inconsistency is real signal — this is
// exactly what preserves fs/locks' `flc_blocker`, whose lockless fast-path caller
// `locks_delete_block` holds no lock at the call).
//
// The base rule is ONE-LEVEL (a callee inherits its direct callers' held locks). It
// is iterated to a bounded fixpoint so a lock held several frames up (the unix GC
// tree holds `unix_gc_lock` two frames above the leaf helpers) reaches a leaf when
// every intermediate call-site is itself under the (already-propagated) lock.
//
// HONEST LIMITS:
//   • NAME-BASED graph, no points-to: two static same-named functions collapse;
//     indirect / function-pointer / macro-expanded calls are invisible edges, so a
//     callee reached ONLY through a function pointer looks call-site-less (an entry
//     point) and is never suppressed (conservative — keeps the candidate).
//   • ONLY IN-SUBSYSTEM call-sites are seen. An EXPORTED function (EXPORT_SYMBOL)
//     has external callers we cannot inspect, which may hold no lock, so exported
//     functions are treated as un-propagatable (kept lockless) to avoid FALSELY
//     suppressing a genuine candidate reached lock-free from outside the subsystem.
//   • Context-INSENSITIVE MUST analysis: one lock-free call-site anywhere defeats
//     propagation for that callee (sound for avoiding false suppression, but it can
//     UNDER-suppress — a helper lock-free on a dead/unrelated path stays flagged).
//   • A function with zero in-subsystem call-sites is an independent entry point and
//     gets no propagation by construction.
