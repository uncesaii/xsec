/**
 * ASSUMPTION-MINING — xsec's FOURTH seedless discovery axis, and the first one
 * that reasons like an auditor instead of pointing a fixed-shape checker at code.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (the gap the other three seedless stages structurally cannot
 * close). subsystem-invariant-model / interproc-refcount / concurrency-race all
 * ask the SAME question — "is THIS access correctly guarded?" — i.e. a LOCAL
 * violation of a FIXED invariant shape (a lock held at a field touch, a get/put
 * balanced, a lockset consistent). The deepest historical LPEs are a DIFFERENT
 * shape and no fixed schema can represent them:
 *
 *   a function RELIES ON a precondition it does NOT itself establish, and a
 *   reachable context reaches the same object WITHOUT establishing it.
 *
 *   DirtyPipe   — splice relies on "PIPE_BUF_FLAG_CAN_MERGE reflects THIS write";
 *                 a reused pipe_buffer reaches the merge path with the flag stale.
 *   AF_UNIX GC  — the GC relies on "in-flight count == real graph reachability";
 *                 an SCM_RIGHTS send reaches the same skb without re-establishing it.
 *   DirtyCred   — a consumer relies on "this file/cred is the one I validated";
 *                 a UAF swaps a same-cache object the validation never covered.
 *   io_uring    — completion relies on "the fd/creds validated AT SUBMIT still hold";
 *                 async handoff reaches it after the establishing context is gone.
 *
 * Our old schema has no field for "ptr validated by caller V" / "fd resolved once" /
 * "state S unreachable here", so we could not hunt their violation. This stage
 * represents exactly that: it MINES the implicit relied-on assumptions each function
 * makes, then adversarially hunts REACHABLE contexts that violate them.

 *            establisher-propagation fixpoint (a caller that INHERITS the establisher
 *            from ITS callers is NOT a violation — the proven FP-killer) leaves only
 *            callers that reach the subject WITHOUT establishing the precondition.
 *      ▼
 *  assumptionsToHuntPlan ──runHuntScan(composeGate(skeptic, …))──▶ confirmed, ranked
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE — read before trusting a context. This is a CANDIDATE generator; a
 * surviving context is an assumption to DISPROVE, not a bug:
 *   • The mine is one LLM turn — assumption extraction precision is the input-quality
 *     bound; 1b removes the mechanically-uncheckable ones but cannot fix a wrong
 *     relied-on claim.
 *   • The caller-scan is NAME-BASED (buildCallGraph): indirect / fn-pointer / macro
 *     call edges are invisible, so a subject reached only through a fn pointer looks
 *     caller-less (no contexts). "Establisher present" is coarse MUST — a caller that
 *     calls the establisher ANYWHERE in its body counts as establishing (conservative:
 *     it SUPPRESSES more, trading recall for a lower FP rate — the point of v0).
 *   • Propagation is the FP-killer but under-suppresses on exported/entry functions
 *     (external callers unknown → treated as not-establishing → kept).
 * Every surviving context flows through the SAME skeptic+prover gate the other stages
 * use; the gate, not this file, adjudicates.

  "\n\nRULES:\n" +
  "  1. establisherToken MUST be a real identifier that appears verbatim in the source (a function/macro call, a " +
  "lock acquire, a validator). NEVER a prose phrase — the checker matches it literally.\n" +
  "  2. Use provenance 'enforced-local' ONLY when the subject establishes the precondition itself; otherwise pick " +
  "the relied-on-* class that says WHO establishes it (caller / subsystem / cross-api / concurrency).\n" +
  "  3. Prefer preconditions on objects reachable from UNPRIVILEGED syscalls, and prefer lifetime / bounds / authz " +
  "/ type relevance (a race on a lifetime pointer, a skipped bounds/authz check) over cosmetic ones.\n" +
  "  4. 'subject' must be an exact function name as defined in the source.\n" +
  "  5. establisherAliases — CRITICAL for precision. When the precondition can be established through a FAMILY of " +
  "tokens (sibling macros like CMSG_LEN/CMSG_SPACE/CMSG_ALIGN, a helper that WRAPS the raw primitive such as " +
  "unix_table_double_lock() wrapping spin_lock(), or several equivalent validators), put the establisherToken as the " +
  "one you consider primary and list EVERY other token that also establishes it in establisherAliases. The " +
  "deterministic checker treats a caller that uses the token OR any alias (directly or through a wrapper) as having " +
  "established the precondition — a missing alias/wrapper is the #1 false-positive source, so be generous here.\n" +
  "  6. Prefer the WRAPPER identifier the surrounding code actually calls (e.g. unix_state_lock, unix_table_double_lock) " +
  "as the establisherToken when one exists, and list the raw primitive it bottoms out in as an alias.\n" +
  "  7. HIGHEST PRIORITY — DUAL-VIEW / CROSS-PHASE seams. The deepest LPEs (DirtyPipe, DirtyCred, fuse " +
  "request-vs-reply, io_uring submit-vs-completion, SCM_RIGHTS install-vs-consume) are NOT single-caller " +
  "preconditions — they are one LONG-LIVED OBJECT reached by TWO DISTINCT APIs/phases where the second phase does " +
  "not re-establish what the first set up. When you see an object that OUTLIVES a single call and is reached from " +
  "MULTIPLE entry points or lifecycle phases (create/open vs release; request/submit vs reply/completion; " +
  "install vs consume), EMIT a relied-on-cross-api assumption for it: set provenance='relied-on-cross-api' (or " +
  "'relied-on-concurrency' for a race), name the STRUCT TYPE in 'object' verbatim (e.g. 'struct fuse_req' — the " +
  "type name is the mechanical join the dual-view checker greps), and pick kind ownership-exclusive / " +

//
// The caller-scan asks "which CALLER of subject S skips S's establisher?" — a
// SINGLE-view question (one call-tree, one entry). The deepest latent LPEs are
// DUAL-view: a long-lived object is set up on ONE entry/phase (request, submit,
// create, fd-install) and reached again on a DISTINCT entry/phase (reply,
// completion, release, receiver) that does NOT re-establish the guarantee the first
// phase relies on. DirtyPipe (write phase vs merge phase on a reused pipe_buffer),
// fuse (request path vs userspace-driven reply path on one fuse_req), SCM_RIGHTS
// (installer vs consumer of a file), io_uring (submit-view vs completion-view of a
// registered fd/creds) are ALL this shape. The caller-scan structurally cannot see
// it: entryB is not a caller of the subject at all.
//
// MECHANISM (deterministic, no LLM). For a cross-api/cross-phase assumption on object
// TYPE O with establisher token E:
//   • touchers(O)   = functions whose body references the type token O (`\bfuse_req\b`).
//                     The proxy for "operates on an O instance" — coarse (type-name,
//                     like the whole stage), precision-over-recall, skeptic adjudicates.
//   • establishing  = touchers whose establisher set (v1 wrapper-closed) contains E.
//   • skipping      = touchers whose establisher set does NOT contain E.
//   • a DUAL-VIEW violation is a pair (entryA ∈ establishing, entryB ∈ skipping) that
//     reach the SAME type via DISTINCT call-trees — NEITHER calls the other (if entryB
//     reached entryA it would inherit E via the establisher set; requiring mutual
//     non-reachability isolates genuinely separate phases/APIs).
//   • require establishing ≠ ∅ — E must be a guarantee the code DOES apply somewhere
//     on O (proof it is a real in-subsystem contract, not an external one 1b mined
//     out); the skipping sibling is then the latent-bug candidate.

// ── FIELD + LOCK GRANULARITY (the precision fix) ────────────────────────────────
//
// v2's dual-view enumerator paired entries that share only the STRUCT TYPE (object).
// A post-mortem of crypto/af_alg.c proved that is too coarse and burns the (small,
// expensive) dynamic-witness budget on NON-seams:
//   • af_alg_alloc_tsgl (mutates ctx->tsgl_list) ⇄ af_alg_poll (reads ctx->more /
//     ctx->used) — a DELIBERATE benign lockless scalar read of DIFFERENT fields, not a
//     lifetime seam on the same field.
//   • af_alg_alloc_tsgl ⇄ af_alg_free_resources (touches ctx->inflight / ctx->rcvused)
//     — DISJOINT fields, not tsgl_list.
// A genuine seam requires the two phases to CONTEND on the SAME field, AND that field
// not to be co-serialized by the same lock in both phases. We refine seam emission
// from (object) to (field, lock) granularity:
//   1. FIELD-MATCH (necessary): the establishing entryA and the skipping entryB must
//      access at least one COMMON struct member of the object. Disjoint fields ⇒ drop.
//   2. LOCK-COVERAGE: for every shared field, if BOTH accesses are covered by the SAME
//      lock (both under lock_sock / the same mutex / spinlock / rcu / guard), that field
//      is serialized. Emit only when some shared field has an access that is LOCKLESS in
//      at least one phase, OR the two phases hold DIFFERENT locks over it.
// DEGRADE-SAFE: when field info cannot be recovered for EITHER side (no typed var, a
// macro-hidden access), we KEEP the pair — reproducing v2's object-granular behavior
// rather than silently dropping. Suppression only ever fires on POSITIVE evidence of
// field-disjointness or same-lock coverage — that bounds the false-negative risk.
