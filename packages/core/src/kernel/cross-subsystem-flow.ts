/**
 * Cross-subsystem data flow tracing for kernel reviews (xsec#469).
 *
 * Bugs like Copy Fail (CVE-2026-31431) emerge from interactions between
 * subsystems — no single function contains the vulnerability. This module
 * provides:
 *
 * 1. A database of kernel subsystems and their boundaries.
 * 2. Known cross-subsystem data flow patterns that have historically
 *    produced vulnerabilities.
 * 3. A static scanner that, given a kernel source tree, identifies files
 *    that sit on cross-subsystem boundaries (calling into or receiving
 *    data from another subsystem).
 * 4. Agent-ready prompt formatting that instructs the agent to follow
 *    data flow across subsystem boundaries.
 *
 * This is NOT a taint engine. It is a static map of cross-boundary data
 * flows for the agent to investigate with its "follow the pointer"
 * heuristic (option (c) from the issue).
