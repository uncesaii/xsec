/**
 * Dirty-frag pattern library — shared-memory aliasing vulnerability class.
 *
 * The "Dirty Frag" class (CVE-2026-31431 / Copy Fail) is an *instance* of a
 * broader vulnerability pattern: any in-place operation on shared/aliased memory
 * without ownership verification.  Eric Biggers (kernel crypto maintainer) noted
 * that ALL AF_ALG exploits follow this general shape — the crypto subsystem
 * operates in-place on buffers whose provenance it doesn't verify.
 *
 * This module defines the pattern library so foxguard (or any SARIF-producing
 * scanner) can classify findings, and so the variant-hunt pipeline can attach
 * richer metadata to each candidate.
 *
 * See: https://github.com/uncesaii/xsec/issues/470
