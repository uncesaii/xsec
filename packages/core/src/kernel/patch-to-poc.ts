/**
 * kernel/patch-to-poc.ts
 *
 * "Patch-to-PoC" directed n-day pipeline — turn an upstream security patch /
 * fix commit into a PoC PLAN for an unpatched downstream LTS/distro kernel.
 *
 * Direction of travel (the whole point): a security bug is fixed UPSTREAM, the
 * fix commit + diff become public, but the same bug is still live on an older
 * LTS / distro kernel where the fix was never backported. The patch itself is
 * the richest possible oracle for the bug — it names the faulting file, the
 * function, and (in the diff hunks) the exact guard that was added. This module
 * mines that signal to produce a directed trigger plan, instead of fuzzing
 * blind. It directly serves our older-LTS / CopyFail page-cache / rxrpc hunt.
 *
 * Lineage:
 *   - arXiv:2602.07287 (patch-directed n-day reproduction): use the fix diff to
 *     localize the bug and synthesize a trigger, then confirm under a sanitizer.
 *   - Project Zero "Big Sleep": LLM-assisted, variant/patch-guided vulnerability
 *     reproduction with a sanitizer as the ground-truth oracle.
 *
 * Four stages, mirroring `distro-adapt.ts`'s deterministic-core + LLM-assist
 * split:
 *   1. ANALYZE THE PATCH (deterministic). Parse the fix commit message + unified
 *      diff: classify the bug (UAF / OOB / race / …), and extract the touched
 *      file(s) + the enclosing function(s) of the changed hunks — the SINK.
 *      Reuses the security-keyword vocabulary + `Fixes:` trailer parsing shared
 *      with `fix-commit-intel.ts`.
 *   2. UNDERSTAND REACHABILITY (deterministic, tree-optional). When a kernel
 *      source tree is on disk, reuse `reachability-rank.ts` to rank the
 *      userspace syscalls that reach the sink — the entry points the trigger
 *      should drive.
 *   3. PRODUCE A PoC PLAN (LLM-assist). Combine the bug class, sink, reaching
 *      syscalls and a target-kernel applicability verdict into a concrete
 *      trigger plan: the syscall sequence + preconditions. The LLM, when
 *      supplied, fleshes out the trigger steps and emits a C reproducer
 *      SKELETON; the deterministic spine (sink, syscalls, applicability) is
 *      always present and never overridden by the model.
 *   4. HAND OFF TO VERIFY. Emit a `KernelVerifyRunnerInput`-shaped handoff (the
 *      program skeleton + expected KASAN signature + target tree) that the
 *      EXISTING verify lane (`verify/kernel-verify.ts` →
 *      `triage/kernel-vm-runner.ts`) consumes to build/boot/KASAN-confirm. We do
 *      NOT reimplement the runner — we produce the plan it eats.
 *
 * Downstream targeting reuses `distro-adapt.ts`: once the trigger shape exists,
 * `adaptReproForDistro` computes the config/precondition deltas for the specific
 * LTS/distro target. This module's `targetApplicability` answers the prior
 * question the adaptation can't: "is this kernel even old enough to still be
 * vulnerable?".
 *
 * HONESTY — the paper's bottlenecks are real and this module does NOT paper over
 * them:
 *   - LARGE-PATCH CONTEXT. A multi-file refactor-style fix dilutes the signal;
 *     the diff parser localizes hunks but cannot know which of N touched
 *     functions is THE sink. We surface ALL touched functions ranked, flag low
 *     confidence, and lean on the LLM/operator to disambiguate.
 *   - DEBUGGER / SANITIZER-OUTPUT INTERPRETATION. Deciding whether a KASAN
 *     splat actually corresponds to the patched bug (vs. an unrelated crash) is
 *     left to the verify lane's signature match — this module only proposes the
 *     EXPECTED signature; it does not adjudicate the real one.
 *
 * Analysis / plan-producing ONLY. No build, no boot, no network, no new deps.

/**
 * Produce a Patch-to-PoC directed n-day plan: from an upstream fix commit / diff
 * to a PoC PLAN for an unpatched downstream `target` kernel.
 *
 * Deterministic spine (always): patch analysis (bug class + sink), reachability
 * ranking when `opts.treePath` is set, a target-applicability verdict, and a
 * compilable reproducer SKELETON wrapped in a verify-lane handoff. LLM-assist
 * (when `llm` supplied): a concrete trigger-step sequence + preconditions + a
 * richer skeleton — advisory; it never removes the deterministic spine.
 *
 * ANALYSIS / PLAN-PRODUCING ONLY. Building, booting and KASAN-confirming the
 * reproducer is the job of the EXISTING verify lane
 * (`verify/kernel-verify.ts` → `triage/kernel-vm-runner.ts`), which consumes
 * `plan.verifyHandoff`. Downstream config/precondition deltas for the specific
 * distro come from `distro-adapt.ts`'s `adaptReproForDistro`.
