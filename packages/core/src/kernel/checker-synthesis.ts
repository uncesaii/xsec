/**
 * kernel/checker-synthesis.ts
 *
 * SELF-VALIDATING CHECKER SYNTHESIS on the incomplete-fix / patch-gap spine
 * (the KNighter / BUGSTONE pattern).
 *
 * This industrializes the single technique that produced our best merged kernel
 * wins (TIPC / mac802154 / NFC were all incomplete-fix variants): given an
 * upstream security fix, LEARN the bug-class invariant the fix enforces, encode
 * it as a concrete checker, PROVE the checker catches its own seed bug, then
 * sweep the checker across the tree for the sibling sites the fix missed.
 *
 * How it differs from what already exists here:
 *   - `incomplete-fix-hunt.ts` mines Fixes:-tagged commits and surfaces untouched
 *     same-FAMILY siblings by NAME (encrypt-fixed / decrypt-unfixed). It has no
 *     model of WHAT the fix enforced — only that a sibling exists.
 *   - `variant-candidates.ts` does a one-shot LLM call per run that emits grep
 *     patterns, but throws them away after the run and never proves they match
 *     anything: an LLM pattern that only matches the original site (or nothing)
 *     is indistinguishable from a good one until a human reads the empty result.
 *   - `variant-hunt.ts` shells the EXTERNAL `foxguard` binary and adapts its
 *     SARIF — a dependency on a tool that must be installed and whose rules are
 *     authored out-of-band.
 *
 * This module closes all three gaps with ONE idea — the load-bearing step is
 * SELF-VALIDATION: a synthesized checker only enters the library if it PROVABLY
 * flags the known-buggy pre-image of its seed fix AND is silent on the post-fix
 * image. That makes the output deterministic (a checker either catches its seed
 * or it's rejected — no "trust the LLM") and COMPOUNDING (validated checkers are
 * persisted and re-run against future trees).
 *
 * The checker is encoded as a bug-class INVARIANT, not a textual diff:
 *   - `sinkPattern`   — an ERE matching the dangerous SHAPE (identifiers
 *                       wildcarded) the fix guarded, e.g. a length-controlled
 *                       copy `memcpy\([^,]+,[^,]+,[^)]*->len\)`.
 *   - `guardPattern`  — an ERE matching the CHECK the fix ADDED (present in the
 *                       post-image, absent in the pre-image), e.g.
 *                       `if \([^)]*->len\s*[<>]`.
 *   - `guardWindow`   — how many lines around a sink the guard may live in.
 * A site is FLAGGED when the sink matches but no guard matches within the
 * window — exactly the "sink present, guard missing" shape a fix closes. This
 * sink+guard+window encoding is what makes self-validation meaningful: the
 * pre-image has the sink without the guard (flagged) and the post-image has the
 * sink WITH the guard (silent), so a correct checker's accept condition is
 * mechanically decidable from git blobs alone.
 *
 * weggli: OPTIONAL accelerator, NOT a dependency. It is not on the engine's
 * scanner allowlist and not installed in the standard image (see the honesty
 * note on `isWeggliAvailable`). The checker carries an emitted `weggliQuery`
 * that is used as an extra sink locator ONLY when the binary is on PATH; the
 * grep/regex invariant matcher above is the always-available source of truth
 * and is what self-validation and the unit tests exercise. This REDUCES — does
 * not remove — the external-tool reliance of `variant-hunt.ts`.
 *
 * Everything shells read-only `git`/`grep` against an already-present local tree
 * (mirroring `fix-commit-intel.ts` / `variant-candidates.ts`) and every I/O
 * boundary is injectable, so the loop is fully offline-testable.
