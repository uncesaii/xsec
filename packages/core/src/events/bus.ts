/**
 * Pluggable event bus for scanner / agent-loop telemetry.
 *
 * The legacy `ScanListener` API (see `../scanner.ts`) only carried coarse
 * stage:start / stage:end / finding events. The cloud worker-controller and
 * future tracing sinks need richer signal — per-turn agent state, tool calls,
 * planner invocations, finding ingests — so this module introduces a
 * fan-out `EventBus` that the rest of the core can `emit()` typed events
 * into, and that any number of `EventSink` consumers can subscribe to.
 *
 * Design goals:
 *
 *   1. Pluggable. Any module that can take an `EventSink` (cloud relay,
 *      in-memory spy for tests, OpenTelemetry exporter, etc.) can subscribe
 *      at process start without the scanner knowing about it.
 *   2. Backwards-compatible. The existing `ScanListener` public API is
 *      preserved via `scanListenerSink()` — an adapter that maps the new
 *      richer event vocabulary back onto the three legacy `ScanEvent`
 *      shapes so external consumers keep receiving familiar signals.
 *   3. Fail-soft. One buggy sink must never be able to abort a scan;
 *      exceptions thrown by a sink are caught and logged to stderr.
 *   4. Opt-in cloud relay. The `CloudEventSink` is OFF by default so
 *      local CLI runs are not spammed with `XSEC_EVENT_*` lines;
 *      enable via `XSEC_CLOUD_EVENTS=1` (checked at subscribe time).
 *
 * Cloud wire format (matches the cloud worker-controller's
 * `parseEventLines` in `xsec-cloud/services/worker-controller/src/poller.ts`):
 *
 *     XSEC_EVENT_<TYPE_UPPER> {"…json payload…"}
 *
 * e.g. `XSEC_EVENT_STEP_STARTED {"step":"recon","n":1}`.
