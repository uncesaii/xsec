// Recon mode — DNS / email security posture for a domain (gap F).
//
// Given a registrable domain, look up and grade the three pillars of email
// anti-spoofing hygiene:
//
//   - SPF   (TXT `v=spf1 …`)  — who is allowed to send mail as this domain,
//                               and how strictly unlisted senders are treated
//                               (the `all` mechanism qualifier).
//   - DMARC (TXT `_dmarc.…`)  — what receivers should do with mail that fails
//                               SPF/DKIM alignment (`p=` policy).
//   - DKIM  (TXT `<sel>._domainkey.…`) — presence of a signing key under a
//                               handful of common selectors.
//
// Grading is intentionally conservative and maps onto xsec finding
// severities. Missing SPF or DMARC is the bigger spoofing exposure (MEDIUM);
// a present-but-weak policy (SPF `~all` softfail, DMARC `p=none`/`p=quarantine`)
// is a LOW hardening note; SPF `-all` + DMARC `p=reject` earns no finding.
//
// Real pilot evidence (doky.ch): SPF ended in `~all` (softfail, weaker than
// `-all`) and DMARC was `p=quarantine` (not `p=reject`) — both surfaced here
// as hardening opportunities rather than hard failures.
//
// No LLM. Network is injected (`resolveTxt`) so the grader is unit-testable
// without touching DNS.
