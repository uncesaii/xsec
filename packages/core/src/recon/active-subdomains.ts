// Active subdomain enumeration (xsec#924).
//
// The passive enumerator (`./subdomains.ts`) only sees what Certificate
// Transparency logs already published. This module adds the *active* leg:
// generate candidate hostnames from a built-in wordlist plus a few cheap
// permutations, then resolve each in DNS and keep the ones that answer. The
// resolving hosts merge into the same `DiscoveredHost` shape the passive path
// emits, so the asset-map assembly in `./recon.ts` can dedupe across both.
//
// SAFETY IS THE DESIGN. Active enumeration touches the target's DNS, so it is
// gated like a scanner — OFF unless the caller explicitly turns it on — and
// every candidate is run through three independent rails before a single DNS
// query is issued:
//
//   * SCOPE      — each candidate host is checked against a `ScopePolicy`
//                  (the same matcher every URL-touching code path uses). A
//                  host that is not in scope is never resolved. With no policy
//                  supplied, the brute-force resolves nothing (deny-by-default).
//   * BOUNDED    — a hard cap on the number of candidates ever generated
//                  (MAX_CANDIDATES), plus bounded resolver concurrency so we
//                  never fan out an unbounded burst of DNS lookups.
//   * TIME-BOXED — a wall-clock deadline acts as a kill-switch: once it passes,
//                  no further candidates are resolved and whatever resolved so
//                  far is returned. There is no retry / amplification path.
//
// Like the passive path, `resolve` is injectable so the whole module is
// unit-testable without a live network or real DNS.
