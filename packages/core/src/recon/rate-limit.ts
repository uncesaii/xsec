// Rate-limit / anti-automation probe for sensitive endpoints (xsec gap H).
//
// Goal: tell whether a sensitive endpoint (login, password-reset, OTP, etc.)
// enforces throttling. The motivating pilot: 20 rapid POSTs to a
// password-reset endpoint all returned 404 with no 429 and no slowdown —
// a clear "no rate limiting" finding.
//
// SAFETY IS THE DESIGN. This module is deliberately:
//   * BOUNDED  — a small fixed burst (default 15) with a HARD CAP of 25
//                requests. There is no unbounded / DoS path. The cap is
//                clamped here regardless of what the caller asks for.
//   * PURE     — it never opens a socket itself. The caller supplies a
//                `request` thunk, so the responsibility for using a SAFE,
//                side-effect-free input (e.g. a clearly non-existent email
//                so no real password-reset mail is ever sent) lives at the
//                call site, and this module stays trivially testable.
//   * NON-DESTRUCTIVE — it only reads HTTP status codes. It does not retry,
//                amplify, or escalate; the burst size never grows.
//
// NO LLM. No network. No shared-file edits.
