// xsec#193 / xsec-cloud#111 — deterministic finding re-verification.
//
// `evaluateVerificationSpec` runs a finding's `VerificationSpec.code[]`
// predicates against a target repo on disk and reports whether the finding
// is still real. It is intentionally *cheap*: no LLM calls, no target
// provisioning, no network. Cloud's canary watcher calls this on every
// upstream HEAD refresh; the OSS engine emits the spec when it produces a
// finding so that re-evaluation later is deterministic.
//
// Behavioural predicates (`VerificationSpec.behavior`) require a provisioned
// target and are out of scope here — the helper short-circuits with a stable
// `behavior eval not yet supported` reason.
