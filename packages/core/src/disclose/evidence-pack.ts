/**
 * #928 — evidence-pack assembler for coordinated disclosure.
 *
 * Turns a confirmed, reproduced-PoC {@link Finding} into a STRUCTURED
 * vendor-notification draft (the what / where / impact / repro / remediation
 * spine a maintainer expects in a first-contact email or advisory). This is the
 * first artifact in the disclosure process — the thing an operator reads,
 * edits, and sends *by hand*.
 *
 * Relationship to the existing renderers:
 *   - `template.ts` `renderAdvisoryMarkdown` produces the full GHSA-shaped
 *     advisory (Title / Severity / CWE / Affected / PoC / Patch status) for the
 *     security-advisory editor. It is the heavier, publish-grade artifact.
 *   - This module produces the lighter *vendor-notification* spine — a plain
 *     what/where/impact/repro/remediation structure, suitable for a first email
 *     to a maintainer who has no advisory editor. It returns a structured
 *     object (so callers can render email vs. markdown) plus a rendered
 *     markdown draft.
 *
 * SAFETY: pure — no I/O, no network, no auto-send. Every emitted string is run
 * through `redactSensitiveHeaders` (the same secret sweep the advisory renderer
 * uses) so an operator session token / cookie / JWT in a PoC step never leaks
 * into a draft. The output is explicitly stamped DRAFT and is never sent or
 * published by this module — the operator gates that (`disclosure/AGENTS.md`).
