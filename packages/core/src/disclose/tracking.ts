/**
 * #928 — coordinated-disclosure status tracking (engine-side model + helpers).
 *
 * xsec already *gates* findings (`triage/verify-verdict.ts` →
 * `isDisclosureWorthy`) and *renders* artifacts (`template.ts` advisory,
 * `writeup.ts` research draft). What it lacked is a model of the disclosure
 * PROCESS — the status timeline a confirmed finding walks once an operator
 * starts coordinating with a vendor: draft → sent → acknowledged → accepted →
 * cve_assigned → published, plus the terminal off-ramps (rejected,
 * not_applicable, duplicate, withdrawn).
 *
 * This module owns that state machine and an append-only event timeline. It is
 * a PURE library: no I/O, no network, no auto-send. It never contacts a vendor
 * and never publishes anything — it only records what an operator did and
 * validates that a requested transition is legal. The operator gates every
 * real-world action (`disclosure/AGENTS.md` hard rules; embargo discipline).
 *
 * VOCABULARY PARITY: the status set and the per-status fields
 * (`disclosed_to`, `disclosed_at`, `cve_id`) are the SAME ones the dashboard
 * schema already defines — `services/dashboard/drizzle/0033_*` +
 * `0045_findings_disclosure_refs.sql` (the `findings_disclosure_status_check`
 * CHECK enum) and `0034_disclosures_and_timeline.sql`
 * (`disclosure_timeline`). The engine and dashboard are decoupled (neither
 * imports the other), so the strings are kept identical by hand and asserted in
 * `tracking.test.ts`. Do NOT introduce engine-only status strings here.
 */
