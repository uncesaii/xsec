/**
 * Hub mailbox — the durable, single-machine message transport (increment 3).
 *
 * This is the transport DESIGN.md recommends (option A): a brokerless
 * filesystem spool under the per-user state dir, one file per message, created
 * atomically so concurrent senders can never collide and a reader can never
 * observe a half-written message. There is no daemon, no election, and — by
 * construction — **no network listener of any kind**.
 *
 * ## On-disk layout
 *
 * ```
 * <homeStateDir()>/hub/<sha256(realpath(project))>/   0700
 *   mbox/<peerId>/new/<ts>-<rand>.msg                 0600  pending direct mail
 *   mbox/<peerId>/cur/<ts>-<rand>.msg                 0600  claimed by an in-flight drain
 *   bcast/<ts>-<rand>.msg                             0600  to:"all", shared by every reader
 *   cursor/<peerId>.json                              0600  which broadcasts this peer consumed
 * ```
 *
 * The rendezvous is keyed by the **realpath** of the project directory, so a
 * symlink cannot alias two different projects (or two different users' trees)
 * into one channel. It lives in the per-user state dir, never in the project
 * tree — a repo may be a shared clone, a container bind mount, or plain
 * world-readable, and a message spool must be none of those.
 *
 * ## Atomicity and crash-safety
 *
 * Sending is a three-step dance that is safe against both concurrent senders
 * and a crash at any instant:
 *
 *   1. Reserve a scratch name with `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` — the kernel guarantees
 *      exactly one sender wins that name, so two senders can never interleave
 *      into the same file.
 *   2. Write the whole payload, `fsync`, `fchmod 0600`, close. The scratch name
 *      is dot-prefixed and ends in `.part`; readers only ever list `*.msg`, so a
 *      partially-written payload is invisible to them by construction.
 *   3. Publish by `link()`ing the scratch name to the final `*.msg` name and
 *      unlinking the scratch. `link` is atomic and fails with `EEXIST` rather
 *      than clobbering, so it can never destroy another sender's message; where
 *      hardlinks are unsupported we fall back to `rename` (also atomic on the
 *      same filesystem) guarded by an existence check.
 *
 * A crash before step 3 leaves only an inert `.part` file that no reader looks
 * at. A crash after step 3 leaves a delivered message plus a stray `.part`.
 * There is no window in which a reader sees a truncated message.
 *
 * Draining is a two-phase claim, which is what keeps a crashed reader from
 * losing mail: {@link drainInbox} first `rename`s each pending file from `new/`
 * into `cur/` (atomic; losing the race just means another reader got it, which
 * we tolerate), and only then reads-and-unlinks each claimed file one at a time.
 * A drain that dies mid-flight leaves every not-yet-returned message sitting in
 * `cur/`, and the next drain sweeps `cur/` back in before touching `new/`.
 * Nothing a reader had not yet returned is ever lost; the cost is the standard
 * at-least-once trade (a message read but not yet unlinked when the process dies
 * is redelivered), so consumers must be idempotent.
 *
 * ## Messages carry data, never authority
 *
 * A {@link HubMessage} is inert prose. This module has no operation that mutates
 * another peer's scope, auth config, tool-approval state, or roster entry, and
 * the message shape has nowhere to put such a thing: `body` is a string that is
 * stripped of ANSI and control characters on decode, and `from`/`to` are roster
 * ids validated against the registry's own id rules. A peer asking another peer
 * to "add evil.com to scope" changes nothing until a human re-approves scope in
 * the receiving session. Consumers should still route `body` through the
 * codebase's untrusted-input sanitizer before it reaches a model's context —
 * this module guarantees the bytes are safe to *display*, not that the prose is
 * trustworthy.
 *
 * ## Time
 *
 * Every timestamp is INJECTED on the message (`ts`). Nothing here reads a clock;
 * `encodeMessage` / `decodeMessage` / `hubDirName` / `stripUnsafeText` are pure
 * and total.
