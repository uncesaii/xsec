/**
 * Hub peer roster — the pure, side-effect-free core of the coordination hub.
 *
 * This module is the FIRST increment of the hub (see DESIGN.md). It owns the
 * data model for the set of peers that can address one another — concurrently
 * running subagents inside one xsec session, and separate xsec sessions working
 * the same project directory — and the pure reconciliation logic that keeps that
 * set consistent as peers appear, heartbeat, restart, and go stale.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here (later increments own these): the filesystem/socket
 * transport that persists and gossips the roster, message delivery, `wait`,
 * process supervision. Nothing in this file touches the filesystem, network,
 * a clock, or spawns a process. `pid` and `cwd` are opaque DATA carried on a
 * record, never dereferenced. `now` and `ttlMs` are always INJECTED so every
 * function is pure, total, and deterministically testable — the codebase forbids
 * `Date.now()` (or any ambient clock) inside logic that has tests.
