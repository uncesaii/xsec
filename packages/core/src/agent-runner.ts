/**
 * Resolve the maximum number of agent-loop turns for a run.
 *
 * ── Why these numbers changed (prompt caching) ──
 *
 * The previous budgets — verify capped at 8 turns, audit at 30 — were set
 * against PR #198 heartbeat data showing per-turn LLM latency growing with
 * conversation history: 5s at turn 1, 60s at turn 14. That growth was never
 * about the model thinking harder; it was the engine re-prefilling the entire
 * transcript on every stateless request. Trimming turns treated the symptom by
 * capping how long the agent was allowed to think.
 *
 * Prompt caching (`runtime/prompt-cache.ts`, default ON) addresses the cause:
 * the system prompt, tool schemas, and settled conversation are now marked with
 * `cache_control` breakpoints and re-read from cache instead of re-billed and
 * re-prefilled each turn. The late-turn tax that justified the tight caps is
 * substantially paid down, so the budgets are re-derived from what the WORK
 * needs rather than from what the latency curve could tolerate.
 *
 * For scale: a competitive system on the same class of task (Crystalline,
 * 89.6% on CyberGym) runs a mean of ~169 turns/task. Everything below still
 * sits at or under that, deliberately.
 *
 * ── The real cost guard ──
 *
 * Turns are a crude proxy for spend. The actual ceiling is `costCeilingUsd` /
 * `ScanCostLedger`, which cuts a run on dollars regardless of turn count — so
 * raising turns raises the CEILING on work, not the floor on spend. A run that
 * finishes in 6 turns still costs 6 turns. That asymmetry is what makes these
 * increases safe: they only bind on runs that were being truncated mid-work.
 *
 * ── Legacy branch deliberately unchanged ──
 *
 * The legacy branch goes through `execute()` (prompt-in/text-out), not
 * `executeNative()`, and prompt caching is implemented only on the native
 * path. The latency/cost argument above therefore does not apply to it, so its
 * budgets stay exactly as they were. Only `verify` gets a small legacy bump,
 * on task-shape grounds rather than caching (see below).
 *
 * ── Env overrides ──
 *
 * All budgets are overridable without a rebuild so they can be swept:
 *   XSEC_MAX_TURNS         — every role and purpose
 *   XSEC_MAX_TURNS_VERIFY  — verify runs only
 *   XSEC_MAX_TURNS_AUDIT   — audit research runs
 *   XSEC_MAX_TURNS_REVIEW  — review research runs
 * The specific variable wins over the global one when both are set.
