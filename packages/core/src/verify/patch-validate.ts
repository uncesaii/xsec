/**
 * Patch generate → validate (AIxCC / Shellphish T7 — root-cause correctness).
 *
 * A `reproduced` verdict proves a reproducer trips KASAN against the unpatched
 * tree. That is necessary but NOT sufficient to claim we understand the
 * ROOT CAUSE: a reproducer can fire for an adjacent reason, or the bug might be
 * misattributed. AIxCC's patch-as-oracle technique closes that gap — generate a
 * candidate fix, apply it, rebuild, and re-run the SAME reproducer:
 *
 *   - KASAN no longer fires under the patched build  ⇒ the patch removed the
 *     defect the reproducer exercised: ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED (`patchValidated`).
 *   - KASAN still fires                              ⇒ the patch did not address
 *     the real defect (wrong root cause, or an incomplete fix).
 *
 * The patched rebuild is cache-keyed by the PATCHED tree fingerprint via
 * {@link prepareKernelVmArtifacts} (a `git apply` leaves the tree dirty, so
 * `git describe --dirty` yields a distinct cache key) — the unpatched and
 * patched kernels never collide in the build cache.
 *
 * Dependency-injectable end to end (LLM patch-gen, the patch applier, the build
 * runner, and the Tier-1 VM runner) so the whole flow unit-tests without an LLM
 * or a QEMU boot. Reuses {@link isKernelGitTree} from `kernel/fix-commit-intel.ts`
 * as the apply guard and {@link checkAlreadyFixed} to give the patch generator
 * upstream-fix context when available.
