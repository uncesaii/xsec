/**
 * Engine C — auto-harness-synthesis (xsec#1228, the field's choke point).
 *
 * The single unblocker for binary/Windows and deep kernel paths
 * (docs/operations/llm-lpe-innovation-plan.md, U3): "the choke point is
 * auto-synthesizing the init handshake / device state so a closed-source driver
 * loads and reaches its vulnerable IOCTL." A mechanized-artifact oracle
 * (mechanized-artifact.ts) can only CONFIRM a bug it can reproduce — and it
 * cannot reproduce a bug it cannot REACH. This module closes that loop: given a
 * target sink (a kernel ioctl/syscall path, or a decompiled Windows driver
 * IOCTL), it drives an LLM to synthesise the harness that OPENS the device, runs
 * the init handshake, builds the arg struct, and issues the call that lands on
 * the sink — validated by a real reachability signal (a KCOV edge hit at the
 * sink, or a crash), not the model's say-so.
 *
 * It reuses two shipped ideas verbatim:
 *   - the two-phase reach→refine trigger (kernel-verify.ts): first prove the
 *     deep path is REACHABLE under a cheap probe build, THEN escalate to the
 *     sanitizer build to nail the crash. Cheap first, expensive only on reach.
 *   - the coverage-feedback re-prompt (kernel-verify.ts): when a run collects
 *     KCOV, feed the model how many NEW edges it reached toward the sink so the
 *     next attempt is guided by real execution coverage, not blind retry.
 *
 * The output is a validated harness (a C/syz reproducer for kernel; a C harness
 * that CreateFile+DeviceIoControls the driver for Windows) that the
 * mechanized-artifact gate's `reproduce` seam then runs through the N×
 * reproduction gate to produce the sanitizer {@link CrashArtifact}.
 *
 * DOMAIN-NEUTRAL by design: the execution + reachability oracle is an INJECTED
 * seam ({@link HarnessRunner}) returning one shape for both worlds — kernel prod
 * wraps kernel-vm-runner with KCOV; Windows prod wraps the Hyper-V host with a
 * WinDbg breakpoint at the dispatch routine. The synth LOGIC is identical, so it
 * is fully unit-testable with a fake runner (no VM, no keys).
