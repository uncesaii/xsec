/**
 * http_audit enforcement primitives.
 *
 * The `http_audit` scan mode (worker-driven, env-configured) layers three
 * NEW guarantees on top of the existing host-only `ScopePolicy` (#215) and
 * per-host `RateLimiter` (#214):
 *
 *   1. Path-PREFIX allowlist — `ScopePolicy` only matches HOSTS. In
 *      http_audit mode the worker may additionally restrict egress to a set
 *      of path prefixes (e.g. only `/api/`). Empty list = allow all paths.
 *
 *   2. Wall-clock kill switch — abort the agent loop cleanly after N seconds
 *      so a runaway scan can't burn budget indefinitely. The abort flushes
 *      partial findings through the normal report-assembly path (NOT
 *      process.exit).
 *
 *   3. Enforcement counters — every scope verdict (in/out), every rate-limit
 *      throttle, and the peak observed RPS are tallied into the frozen
 *      `enforcement_summary` block the worker contract requires.
 *
 * All three are carried on a single mutable `EnforcementTracker` instance,
 * created once per scan and threaded down through `AgentConfig` →
 * `NativeAgentConfig`/legacy `AgentConfig` → `ToolContext` so every fetch
 * chokepoint mutates the same counters.
 */

 *   - A prefix `/api`  → matches `/api`, `/api/`, `/api/v1/users`, but NOT
 *     `/apixyz` (we treat the prefix as a path-segment boundary so that

 *     so `/api/` and `/api` behave identically.
