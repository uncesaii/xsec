/**
 * Scope-guard visibility (xsec#133).
 *
 * A family of egress guards in `agent/tools.ts` is nested inside
 * `if (this.ctx.scope) { … }`. `ctx.scope` is `undefined` whenever no
 * `ScopePolicy` was configured. Managed dispatch historically omitted
 * `--scope` for all modes except `http_audit`, which synthesizes a host policy
 * from its allowed-host configuration. Local runs without `--scope` had the
 * same inert guard state.
 *
 * That in itself is not automatically a vulnerability — most of those modes
 * (source review, package audit, kernel review) have no live target and no
 * engagement to be out of. The actual defect is that the absence was
 * **invisible**: nothing in the CLI output, the scan event log or the report
 * said the guards had not run, so a reviewer reading the guard block
 * reasonably concluded bash traffic was checked.
 *
 * This module is the small, shared vocabulary for scope enforcement. It is
 * consumed at three sites:
 *
 *   1. `agenticScan()` refuses a live network target before it initializes a
 *      database, model, tool, subprocess, or network client when no scope is
 *      configured.
 *   2. `agenticScan()` emits a structured `scope_guards_inert` event for
 *      unscoped local modes.
 *   3. `ToolExecutor.shellExec()` records egress destinations when a local
 *      mode intentionally runs without a scope.
 *
 * `XSEC_REQUIRE_SCOPE` remains available to make every mode fail closed.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/uncesaii/xsec/issues/133
 */

/**
 * The guards in `ToolExecutor.shellExec` that live inside `if (ctx.scope)` and
 * therefore do not run when no `ScopePolicy` is configured. Stable, greppable
 * identifiers — they are written into the scan event log, so a reviewer can
 * answer "which checks did NOT run on this scan?" from the DB.
 *
 * NOTE: bash's *other* guards are deliberately NOT listed, because they are
 * scope-independent and still run: the http_audit no-explicit-URL egress
 * refusal, the per-host rate-limit pacing, the wallclock ceiling and the env
 * sanitiser are all outside the `if (ctx.scope)` block.
