First confirm this is a kernel tree (look for MAINTAINERS, top-level Kconfig, KERNELRELEASE in Makefile, arch/<name>/). If it's not, refuse and stop.

Map the attack surface: SYSCALL_DEFINE* macros, .unlocked_ioctl/.compat_ioctl handlers, genl_family/netlink_kernel_create, char-device file_operations, eBPF (kernel/bpf/), netfilter hooks (nf_register_net_hook).

Step 2a — pick a target PRIMITIVE first, then reason BACKWARD. Before free-reading, decide what you are hunting: a page-cache write, a controlled indirect call (ops->/work_struct->func/->release fn-ptr), a refcount underflow, or an arbitrary write. Then reason backward from the primitive to its sink, the data flow that reaches it, and the UNPRIVILEGED syscall/ioctl/netlink/socket op that starts that flow. Prefer write / controlled-indirect-call primitives over read-only leaks. PRIVILEGE IS LOAD-BEARING — a chain behind CAP_SYS_ADMIN or a root-only node is NOT a finding; verify unprivileged reachability (optionally unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)) — the keyctl/AF_ALG lesson — and state the privilege precondition for every finding.

Prioritize: missing copy_from_user length validation, signed/unsigned int comparison on user-controlled length, UAF across __free_pages/kfree_skb error paths, refcount races (get_task_struct without matching put_task_struct), TOCTOU on inode->i_*, unsafe_get_user/unsafe_put_user outside a user_access_begin/end block, shared-memory aliasing / Dirty Frag class — any in-place operation on shared/aliased memory without ownership verification: (0) in-place AEAD/cipher on shared skb frag without skb_cow_data/skb_unshare, (a) splice + in-place crypto on non-COW page-cache pages (Copy Fail / CVE-2026-31431), (b) sendfile/splice into io_uring fixed buffers aliasing page cache, (c) vmsplice user-page aliasing with in-kernel pipe consumers, (d) any AF_ALG algorithm type (skcipher/hash/rng/aead/akcipher) operating in-place on spliced pages, (e) generic writes to struct page * without page_count/PagePrivate ownership check.

Step 2b — concrete hunt recipes (highest-yield classes):
(a) Page-cache provenance / zero-copy ingress (Copy Fail; CVE-2026-43284, CVE-2026-46300, CVE-2026-31431): start at a zero-copy ingress API (splice / MSG_SPLICE_PAGES / vmsplice / sendfile / AF_ALG algif_* recvmsg/sendmsg), follow page refs forward to any in-place STORE on an sg/scatterlist entry or skb frag WITHOUT a COW. Audit the SKBFL_SHARED_FRAG set-vs-checked asymmetry (set sites vs skb_has_shared_frag/skb->data_len check sites), skb_cow_data/skb_unshare COW-skip fast paths (can the fast path be entered with a shared frag?), and req->src == req->dst in-place crypto on a page-cache-backed source SGL.
(b) Release-path uncancelled-work UAF / controlled indirect call (the meson-vdec / seq_midi shape; mtk-jpeg / media release-work family): an object owning a work_struct/delayed_work/timer_list/tasklet/ops fn-ptr is freed in a ->release/->remove/->disconnect/->close path or error label WITHOUT a preceding cancel_work_sync/cancel_delayed_work_sync/del_timer_sync/tasklet_kill — the queued work fires after the free → controlled indirect call. Richest in drivers/media, sound/, drivers/usb; cancel_*_work_sync → disable_*_work_sync re-queue is the same UAF.
(c) Write-before-validate in crypto/verify paths: in AEAD/MAC/signature verify (crypto_aead_decrypt, *_verify, ESP/IPsec input, fs-verity, dm-verity, module-sig, rxrpc/Kerberos), check whether plaintext/output is written to a caller-visible buffer or committed to page cache/skb BEFORE the tag/signature is verified (crypto_memneq/memcmp). Decrypt-then-write-before-check = unverified-plaintext write primitive + oracle. The fix marker is the verify gating the write.

Validation: every finding must point to either a syzkaller-style program (.syz) or a C reproducer using syscall(SYS_*, ...). NOT libFuzzer — kernel state isn't reachable from a libFuzzer harness. Static-only findings flagged confidence: 0.4 hypothesis: true (until verification phase #271 lands). Do NOT compile the kernel from this loop.

First confirm this is an XNU tree (look for osfmk/, bsd/, iokit/, libkern/, pexpert/). If it's not, refuse and stop. Note the XNU version (config/MasterVersion, README.md, or Makefile) — it tells you which fixes should already be present.

Map the attack surface: IOKit user clients (externalMethod / getTargetAndMethodForIndex / IOExternalMethodDispatch, reached via IOConnectCallMethod), Mach traps (mach_trap_table in osfmk/kern/syscall_sw.c), MIG routines (.defs server stubs, the is_io_* IOKit family), BSD syscalls (copyin/copyout in bsd/kern/), cdevsw .d_ioctl handlers (bsd/dev/), sysctl handlers, and Mach VM (vm_user.c: vm_allocate/vm_copy/vm_remap/mach_make_memory_entry).

Prioritize: IOKit externalMethod selector/count confusion (selector indexes the method table without a bounds check → OOB function-pointer call; scalarInputCount/structureInputSize not validated against the dispatch entry), copyin length not bounded against the kalloc/IOMalloc destination, copyout of uninitialized kernel struct (infoleak), integer overflow in kalloc/IOMalloc(count*size), Mach port refcount imbalance (ip_release skipped or doubled on an error path → leak/UAF), MIG/mach_msg OOL descriptor type/size confusion, Mach VM aliasing (vm_map_copy reuse, named-entry size/prot confusion), OSDynamicCast result used without NULL check (type confusion).

Validation: every finding must point to a C reproducer SHAPE — IOKit: IOServiceOpen + IOConnectCallMethod(conn, selector, scalarIn, scalarInCnt, structIn, structInSize, ...); Mach: a mach_msg / MIG sequence; BSD: syscall()/ioctl()/sysctlbyname().

First confirm this is decompiled output (fcn.0x.../demangled C++ names, func_0x... calls, a *.manifest.txt of symbols). If it's normal C source, refuse and say to use xnu-kernel/c-library. Read the *.manifest.txt first — it lists the externalMethod/dispatch/copyin symbols, your entry points.

Reading decompiled code WITHOUT hallucinating (critical): the input is type-less. \`*(arg+0x20/0x28/0x38/0x40)\` on an IOKit dispatch handler maps to IOExternalMethodArguments fields scalarInput/scalarInputCount/structureInput/structureInputSize — map offsets to fields and SAY which mapping you used. \`unaff_RDI\`=this, \`unaff_RSI\`=first arg. \`func_0x...\`=unresolved call (UNKNOWN, not proof of anything). \`UNINIT\`=a stripped debug poison constant, not a sentinel. Dispatch tables (sMethods) and the COUNT literal in dispatchExternalMethod(table, selector, COUNT) ARE trustworthy symbols.

Hunt (highest LPE value first): IOKit selector/count bugs (selector indexed into sMethods without a bound vs the COUNT literal → OOB call); per-method scalarInputCount/structureInputSize not validated before use; copyin/IOMemoryDescriptor length unbounded vs the IOMalloc/kalloc destination; integer overflow in IOMalloc(count*size); OSDynamicCast result used without NULL check.

Grounding gate: state the offset→field mapping; cite the real COUNT literal + the sMethods table for count bugs; if safety hinges on an unresolved func_0x..., mark hypothesis:true. Decompiled-only findings cap at confidence 0.5 and need binary re-verification.
