// ── Verification Spec (xsec#193 / xsec-cloud#111) ───────────────────────
//
// A `VerificationSpec` is a *machine-executable* contract attached to a
// finding. It answers a single question: "is this finding still real?".
//
// The engine emits the spec when it produces a finding. Cloud (and OSS
// callers) can later evaluate it against a fresh checkout of the target
// repo to decide if the underlying vulnerability has been patched, partially
// fixed, or is still exploitable — without re-running the full LLM agent.
//
// The spec is split into two layers:
//
// 1. `code[]` — pure code-level predicates. Cheap, deterministic, no target
//    provisioning required. All predicates must pass for the finding to
//    still count as vulnerable. If any fails, surface as `partial-fix`.
//
// 2. `behavior` — optional behavioural predicate. Requires a provisioned
//    target. If present and its exploit predicate fails, the finding is
//    `fixed` regardless of what `code[]` says.
//
// The field is OPTIONAL and ADDITIVE on `Finding`. Existing findings produced
// before this type existed leave it undefined and continue to round-trip
// unchanged through every renderer, exporter, the DB, and the cloud sink.

/**
 * Code-level predicate. Each variant is a discriminated union keyed on
 * `kind`. File-based variants use repo-relative paths (resolved against the
 * repoRoot the verifier is given). Patterns are JS regex source strings (so
 * they can be persisted as JSON and re-hydrated cleanly).
 *
 * - `file-contains` — file exists AND its contents match `pattern` (with
 *   optional regex `flags`). The vulnerable shape should still be present.
 * - `file-missing-pattern` — file exists AND its contents do NOT match
 *   `pattern`. Used to assert that a fix-marker (e.g. an `assertAdmin`
 *   call) is still absent.
 * - `file-exists` — file simply exists. Cheapest predicate; useful when the
 *   vulnerable file has a stable name but the shape is hard to pin
 *   with a single regex.
 * - `ast-shape` — tree-sitter query against the file's parsed AST.
 *   Stronger than regex but costs a tree-sitter dependency. Marked as
 *   not-yet-implemented in the OSS verifier; treated as "skipped" when
 *   evaluated, which is conservative (an unimplemented predicate cannot
 *   prove the finding is fixed).
 * - `git-diff-applies` — an evidence diff generated at `baseCommit` still
 *   applies cleanly to the repository HEAD. This proves source compatibility
 *   of the artifact, not runtime exploitability.

// ── Source Code Review (xsec review) ──

/**
 * Review profile selects the prompt + harness strategy.
 *
 * - `default`: application-layer review (web, JS/TS/Python/Go business logic).
 * - `c-library`: foundational C/C++ libraries — memory safety, integer
 *   bugs, allocation paths. Pairs with the tier-1/2/3 harness scaffolder.
 * - `linux-kernel`: Linux kernel source review — syscall/ioctl/netlink
 *   surface, copy_from_user discipline, refcount races, skb cow/share
 *   violations (Dirty Frag class), TOCTOU on inode fields. Static-only;
 *   verification phase is xsec#271 (kernel oracle) and xsec#272
 *   (syzkaller harness scaffold).
 * - `cardano-onchain`: Cardano on-chain smart-contract review (Aiken /
 *   Plutus / Plutarch). EUTXO validator *logic* bugs — double satisfaction,
 *   missing signer checks, unconserved value, unauthorized mint, datum
 *   trust, staking/withdrawal tricks. No memory-safety surface; verification
 *   is a transaction the validator wrongly admits.
 * - `solana-onchain`: Solana on-chain program review (Anchor / native Rust).
 *   Account-model *authorization* bugs — missing signer/owner checks, account
 *   substitution / type confusion, missing PDA seed+bump validation, arbitrary
 *   CPI / unchecked program id, missing Anchor `has_one`/constraint binding,
 *   integer overflow/rounding in AMM/lending math, missing rent/close-account
 *   checks, duplicate-mutable-account, unvalidated `remaining_accounts`. No
 *   memory-safety surface (Rust + BPF VM); verification is an instruction the
 *   program wrongly processes against a substituted account.
 * - `evm-onchain`: EVM on-chain smart-contract review (Solidity / Foundry /
 *   Hardhat) — "0contract". DeFi/bridge *value-logic* bugs — reentrancy
 *   (classic/cross-function/read-only/cross-contract), access-control /
 *   missing-auth / init front-run, oracle & price manipulation (spot vs
 *   manipulable TWAP, stale feeds), rounding / first-depositor share inflation,
 *   signature / permit / EIP-712 replay, cross-chain message verification &
 *   replay (source-chain/nonce/domain binding), delegatecall / proxy storage
 *   collision, unchecked external-call return, MEV/sandwich, unbounded-loop DoS.
 *   No memory-safety surface (EVM VM); verification is a Foundry test that
 *   drains or corrupts. Distinct from cardano-onchain (EUTXO) and solana-onchain
 *   (account model).
 * - `cairo-onchain`: Cairo / Starknet on-chain smart-contract review (Cairo 1+,
 *   Scarb, starknet-foundry). Starknet DeFi *value-logic* bugs — caller /
 *   ownership auth gaps (missing `assert(get_caller_address() == owner)`),
 *   fixed-point share-conversion rounding (the zkLend / Vesu class), reentrancy
 *   via `call_contract`, storage / mapping default-value trust, unchecked
 *   external-call results, L1↔L2 message & `l1_handler` access control, oracle
 *   staleness. No memory-safety surface (STARK-proven VM); `felt252` wraps mod p
 *   but `u256`/`u128` overflow-panic, and failure is `assert`/`panic` (a revert)
 *   so classic "unchecked return" idioms mostly do NOT apply. Verification is a
 *   starknet-foundry (`snforge`) test that drains/corrupts. Distinct from
 *   evm-onchain (Solidity/message-call), cardano-onchain (EUTXO), and
 *   solana-onchain (account model).
 * - `move-onchain`: Move on-chain smart-contract review (Sui Move / Aptos Move).
 *   Move resource / capability *value-logic* bugs — object / capability
 *   ownership & instance-binding gaps (the Cetus / Scallop unconstrained-object
 *   class), arithmetic overflow / truncation in shared math libs (the Cetus
 *   `integer_mate` `checked_shlw` $223M class), uninitialized / reward-index
 *   accounting (the Scallop `last_index` class), public-transfer / capability
 *   leakage, shared-object consensus races, `init` / one-time-witness misuse,
 *   coin / balance conservation. No memory-safety surface (linear-resource VM);
 *   native `+ - *` abort on overflow (so the real class is bit-shifts / casts /
 *   unsound hand-rolled `checked_*` helpers), and failure is `abort` (a revert).
 *   Verification is a `sui move test` / `aptos move test` unit test that
 *   drains/corrupts. Distinct from the account/EUTXO/message-call profiles.
 * - `cardano-haskell`: Cardano FIRST-PARTY Haskell node-stack review
 *   (cardano-ledger, plutus / the Plutus script evaluator, ouroboros-network,
 *   cardano-wallet, cardano-cli/cardano-api, cardano-base, plutus-apps).
 *   Off-chain INFRASTRUCTURE bugs — partial functions / decoder panics on
 *   untrusted input (DoS), FFI memory-safety across `foreign import`/`Ptr`
 *   (the cardano-base `encryptedDerivePublic` OOB class), `unsafePerformIO`/
 *   `unsafeCoerce` misuse, lazy-eval space leaks, integer/`Natural` underflow
 *   & div-by-zero, Plutus-VM budget/eval flaws, ledger STS rule gaps, and
 *   MVar/STM deadlock/race. Distinct from `cardano-onchain` (validator logic
 *   on a memory-safe VM). Semgrep is Haskell-blind, so this profile is
 *   LLM-review-driven (source reading, not scanner triage).
 * - `xnu-kernel`: Apple XNU (macOS/iOS) kernel source review — Mach
 *   trap + MIG surface, IOKit user-client externalMethod dispatch,
 *   BSD syscall/copyin discipline, Mach port refcount + OOL descriptor
 *   bugs, Mach VM aliasing. Static-only hypotheses; verification on
 *   Apple hardware (KASAN research kernel) is decoupled, not in-loop.
 * - `xnu-re`: review of DECOMPILED Apple kext pseudo-C (closed kexts from
 *   a kernelcache, where the real LPE surface lives). Input is type-less
 *   r2ghidra output (see scripts/xnu-re-extract.sh); the profile is tuned
 *   to read offset-soup + recover IOKit ABI fields, and gates findings
 *   behind binary re-verification.
