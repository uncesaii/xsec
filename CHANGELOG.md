# Changelog

All notable changes to XSEC (the open-source CLI + agent harness) are tracked
here. The history before v0.11.0 lives in the git log and on the GitHub
Releases page; this file starts the human-readable summary from v0.11.0
onwards. Entries before v0.13.0 predate the pwnkit → XSEC rename and keep the
old product name as written.

The format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and XSEC adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
on the published npm package and the GitHub Release tag.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `xsec lens-synth --watch --promote` now evolves additive appsec finder lenses
  from curated, corpus-gated misses into a user-owned registry. Promotions and
  rollbacks are hash-linked and hot-load only for future source engagements;
  active engagements remain pinned.
- `0` and `xsec tui` retain chat as the primary OpenTUI surface. Chat-owned
  `/run` opens one explicit-target engagement pane rather than separate
  scan/audit/review/deep-review launch modes; a deep source engagement uses the
  current validated finder-lens strategy through the shared unified runner.
- Chat `/capabilities` now exposes the harness capability catalogue with
  explicit `ready`, `confirm`, and `blocked` safety tiers; every OpenTUI pane
  is routed through the typed chat navigation contract.
- ChatGPT Codex now uses `codex login --device-auth` from the chat-owned
  provider pane. It never enters the generic API-key store or asks for an
  OpenAI API key; OpenAI remains a separate API-key provider.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- A versioned `xsec.presentation/v1` contract now carries canonical reports,
  renderer-neutral console transcripts, and semantic events across the CLI,
  browser dashboard, and output adapters.
- The console can open a virtualized transcript review with `/transcript` (or
  `/review`), focus a live subagent's real transcript, and let an operator
  message that focused subagent.
- `--print`, `--resume`, `--continue`, and the `-p`, `-r`, `-c`, and `-m`
  aliases support one-shot and saved-session CLI workflows.
- The local dashboard provides a same-origin presentation-event SSE endpoint
  with resumable cursor replay.
- Framework packs, model-catalog synchronization, canonical benchmark
  integrations, and isolated replay runners expand the reusable assessment
  surface.

### Changed

- Terminal, JSON, Markdown, HTML, SARIF, PDF, dashboard, and native-console
  projections now consume shared presentation documents instead of deriving
  state from renderer-specific output.
- The OpenTUI console captures direct application stdout/stderr while it owns
  the terminal, preserving those writes as transcript events and preventing
  framebuffer corruption.
- Console defaults now use the Midnight theme; transcript, tool-card, composer,
  sidebar, and focused-subagent surfaces were refined for legibility.
- The optional `xsec-cli` npm launcher downloads the matching platform-specific
  release asset on first invocation when published to npm.

### Fixed

- Packaged native binaries embed JIT skill YAML rather than failing to load
  source-only skill assets.
- Markdown rendering no longer damages generic or unlabeled fenced code blocks.
- Dependency overrides remove the previously reported audit advisories.
- Standalone release binaries embed tree-sitter's parser and C grammar addons;
  CI now removes build-host `node_modules` before its binary smoke test.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- `/theme` switches the console colour theme with live preview (arrow to
  preview, Enter to keep, Esc to revert).
- `/settings` is now a tabbed screen (one tab per category) instead of one long
  scroll; a `/shortcuts` reference lists every keybinding (also reachable from
  settings via `?`).
- `xsec console` gains `--yolo` / `--mode <standard|recon|copilot|yolo>` launch
  flags (YOLO still requires `--scope`).

- `bench improvement-assess` binds sealed improvement results to champion and
  challenger artifact digests, evaluates promotion gates, and writes a
  create-once decision plus hash-chained ledger snapshot. Generic artifacts
  require human approval; the command never executes or deploys a candidate.
- The stdio MCP server accepts `--tools <comma-separated-names>` to limit the
  model-visible XSEC tool set. The source-checkout DSH runner defaults to the
  bounded recon profile rather than exposing every live tool schema.

### Changed

- Fresh `scan`, `audit`, `review`, legacy scanner, MCP, and persisted-ingest
  executions now own `~/.xsec/runs/<run-id>/state.db` rather than contending
  on one user-global SQLite file. `xsec history` and `xsec findings list`
  aggregate run-local state; `xsec resume` resolves an unambiguous abbreviated
  run id.
- Managed workers bind the local run directory, database, and final report to
  their managed scan id. The worker controller retrieves that report after the
  engine exits and posts it through the retrying, idempotent final-report path,
  so transient per-finding webhook loss cannot silently erase the completed
  scan's findings.

### Changed

- The console top bar shows the running version (`v<VERSION>`, auto-tracked).
  Pressing Enter during a running turn now interrupts it and sends the message
  immediately, rather than only queuing it. The line-mode (non-TTY) fallback
  gained the `recon` mode and stops silently ignoring commands it can't run.

### Fixed

- Hardened the plugin registry fetch: refuse redirects (no http/SSRF downgrade),
  cap body size, add a timeout, and bound processed entries.
- Closed a self-extension reserved-name gate gap and fixed a console tool-schema
  bug that dropped array `items` (array tool params were mis-described).
- The full CLI test suite now gates CI (was an 8-of-114-file subset), fixing 27
  regressions that had accumulated unseen; revived the real-binary smoke test.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-19

### Changed — pwnkit is now XSEC

The engine and CLI are renamed from pwnkit to XSEC, matching the public
repository (`uncesaii/xsec`):

- **Package identity:** the root bundle is `xsec`. The workspace CLI package is
  `xsec-cli`; the binary shipped by both is **`xsec`**, with **`0`** as a
  short shell alias (`0 scan ...`). Neither package is published to npm yet.
- **Container image**: `ghcr.io/uncesaii/xsec` (was `ghcr.io/0sec-labs/pwnkit`).
- **Standalone distribution:** GitHub Releases ship verified binaries for Apple
  Silicon macOS, Linux x64 and arm64, and Windows x64. Install with
  `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uncesaii/xsec/main/install.sh | bash`
  on supported Unix hosts, or download the matching release asset directly.
- **Environment variables**: the public env contract moved from `PWNKIT_*` to
  `XSEC_*` (e.g. `XSEC_MODEL`, `XSEC_CLOUD_TOKEN`). At CLI startup, any legacy
  `PWNKIT_*` value is copied onto its `XSEC_*` equivalent when the new name is
  unset, so existing deployments keep working; the new name always wins
  (`packages/cli/src/env-legacy.ts`).
  Note: POSIX shells reject digit-leading variable names, so `XSEC_*` vars
  cannot be set or expanded in bash/sh directly — use `env XSEC_FOO=... 0
  ...`, or keep using the permanently supported `PWNKIT_*` names in shell
  contexts. Docker `-e`, CI env blocks, and systemd units are unaffected.
- **Workspace packages** moved from the `@pwnkit/*` scope to `@xsec/*`.
- Internal canary/marker strings (`PWNKIT-CANARY:`, `PWNKIT-INITRAMFS-*`,
  `PWNKIT-INJ-OK`) are wire protocol tokens between generated exploits and the
  verifier; they are unchanged and not part of the public interface.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added — z-ai (GLM) and kimi (Moonshot) providers

pwnkit-cli can now drive scans through Z.ai's GLM models and Moonshot's Kimi K3
"coding" endpoint. Both are Anthropic-compatible: they ride pwnkit's existing
`/v1/messages` wire (`x-api-key` + `anthropic-version` headers, Anthropic-shaped
request body + response parser) rather than the OpenAI chat/completions path.
Each provider is selected by an explicit operator opt-in key, and either wins
over the global env priority when the requested model maps to it (e.g.
`glm-5.2` → z-ai, `k3` → kimi), so one process can fan calls across providers.

- **feat(llm-api): add Z.ai GLM provider — Anthropic-compatible wire.**
  Activated by `Z_AI_API_KEY`; base URL overridable via `Z_AI_BASE_URL`
  (default `https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic`), default model `glm-5.2`. GLM's
  hybrid reasoning is off by default on this endpoint, so pwnkit enables it via
  the Anthropic extended-thinking field; the budget is tunable through
  `PWNKIT_ZAI_THINKING_BUDGET` (default 2048, `0` disables).
- **feat(llm-api): add Kimi K3 (Moonshot) provider + pricing** (#68).
  Activated by `KIMI_API_KEY`; base URL overridable via `KIMI_BASE_URL`
  (default `https://api.kimi.com/coding` — distinct from Z.ai so kimi requests
  never hit api.z.ai), default model `k3`. K3 emits native `thinking` blocks on
  the Anthropic wire, so no thinking body param is applied.
- **note(runtime): prompt caching is opt-in and fails closed for these two.**
  Because their cache semantics are unverified, GLM and Kimi emit **no**
  `cache_control` markers by default (byte-identical bodies to before). Opt in
  per provider via `PWNKIT_PROMPT_CACHE_EXTRA_PROVIDERS` (comma-separated, e.g.
  `z-ai,kimi`).
- **fix(runtime): guard the Anthropic-wire routing with a positive predicate.**
  z-ai/kimi previously rode the Anthropic wire only by being absent from the
  `isOpenAICompat` getter while carrying a misleading `wireApi:"chat_completions"`
  tag. Routing now keys off an explicit `isAnthropicWire` predicate; the
  `wireApi` field for these two is an inert, intentionally-unused default.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added — chatgpt-codex direct-API provider

pwnkit-cli can now drive scans through a user's ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscription
via the operator's existing `codex login` auth — no Platform API key required.
The new `chatgpt-codex` provider reuses pwnkit's own Responses-API path, OWN
prompts, OWN tools, OWN agent loop, and OWN cost/turn caps; the `codex` CLI
is **not** spawned as a child process, so all scan modes (web + audit + review)
keep native pwnkit control on top of the subscription-billed zero-marginal-cost
auth path.

- **feat(runtime): chatgpt-codex provider — direct API via ChatGPT OAuth** (#327)
  Activates when `PWNKIT_CHATGPT_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN` is set; takes priority
  over api-key providers. Mirrors opencode's ChatGPT-Codex pattern with
  pwnkit-specific headers (`originator: pwnkit`, `ChatGPT-Account-Id` from JWT,
  stable `session_id`). `max_output_tokens` is intentionally omitted per the
  upstream convention.
- **fix(llm-api): send `instructions` field for chatgpt-codex Responses** (#330)
  System prompts were being dropped from the Codex `/responses` body; the
  provider now forwards them in the `instructions` field where Codex expects
  them.
- **fix(llm-api): capture chatgpt-codex tool calls from `output_item.done`** (#331)
  Tool calls were being missed when the Codex stream delivered them as
  `output_item.done` events rather than as deltas. The parser now reads from
  both paths.
- **fix(llm-api): prefer streamed items over empty Codex `output[]`** (#332)
  The terminal `response.completed` event sometimes ships an empty `output[]`;
  pwnkit now keeps the items accumulated from the stream instead of clobbering
  them with the empty terminal payload.
- **feat(llm-api): accept pre-issued ChatGPT Codex `access_token` via env** (#334)
  `PWNKIT_CHATGPT_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` lets the cloud orchestrator inject a
  short-lived access token directly, skipping the refresh-token exchange.
  Refresh-token flow remains the default for local operators.

### Added — audit `done` coverage gate

Audit and review sub-agents could previously emit `done` after a single
`read_file: package.json` and exit in 11 seconds with 0 findings. A recent
`@vercel/og` batch (also `@vercel/postgres`, `@vercel/kv`, `@vercel/blob`,
`@vercel/edge-config`, `@auth0/nextjs-auth0`) hit this failure mode; working
scans on the same pipeline made hundreds of tool calls and produced 26
findings each, so the bug was in the agent's `done` heuristic, not the
targets.

- **feat(audit): refuse `done` from sub-agents that haven't inspected source** (#335)
  When a sub-agent with role ∈ {audit, review} and a `scopePath` calls `done`,
  a coverage gate runs. It passes when **any** of:
    1. `>= PWNKIT_AUDIT_MIN_COVERAGE_FILES` (default 3) distinct source files
       have been read (extensions: `.ts/.tsx/.js/.mjs/.cjs/.jsx` plus
       `.py/.rs/.go/.java/.rb/.php/.c/.h/.cpp/.hpp`),
    2. at least one `run_command` invocation succeeded,
    3. wall-clock > 60s **and** >= 5 tool calls, or
    4. the agent has already been rejected twice in this session
       (no deadlock on a legitimately-empty audit).
  Rejections return a tool-result error with concrete next-step guidance
  ("read `src/index.*` or `lib/index.*`, or run a `run_command` with
  grep/rg"). The gate is scoped to source-code audits — flag-hunting against
  remote targets is unaffected, and discovery/attack/verify roles bypass it
  entirely. Threshold is tunable via `PWNKIT_AUDIT_MIN_COVERAGE_FILES`.
