description: How XSEC scores on public security benchmarks — a secondary, condition-specific signal.
---

**We care about real vulnerabilities, not leaderboards.** XSEC's proof is the
running, verified track record of real bugs disclosed in the Linux kernel and
widely-used open source, with maintainer review.

Public CTF benchmarks are a *secondary* signal. They tell you the core pipeline
isn't broken; they don't tell you the agent finds real CVEs. CTF challenges are
far smaller than real repos, and cross-project scores are protocol-sensitive
(different fork, model, turn cap, retry protocol), so treat every number below as
specific to its test conditions, not a like-for-like leaderboard.

## Where XSEC stands (honest, condition-specific)

| Benchmark | Score | Conditions & caveats |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| [XBOW](https://github.com/xbow-engineering/validation-benchmarks) web CTFs | **93 / 95 = 97.9%** black-box | gpt-5.4 model-specific cohort — per-model single-shot solve rate, not a best-of-N union. ~$0.48/run, **$5.20/flag**. |
| [Cybench](https://github.com/andyzorigin/cybench) | **36 / 40 = 90.0%** | First full-suite run, single-config (Azure gpt-5.4), single-shot, 3 retries. BoxPwnr's 40/40 is best-of-N across ~10 configs — not directly comparable. |
| npm audit (81 packages) | **F1 = 0.973** | `none` profile, 100% TPR, FPR 0.11. Self-published ground-truth set; see the [ablation log](/research/2026-04-11-ablation/). |
| AI/LLM suite (10 challenges) | 10 / 10 | Self-authored regression suite, not an independent benchmark. |
| [AutoPenBench](https://github.com/lucagioacchini/auto-pen-bench) / [HarmBench](https://www.harmbench.org/) | Not scored yet | Harness built; no published score. |

**Read the numbers honestly.** The XBOW figure we lead with is the per-model
gpt-5.4 cohort (93/95), because it is a stable single-model solve rate rather than
a union over an aging artifact-retention window. A wider retained-artifact
aggregate exists but is rotation-volatile and is not the headline. Benchmarks here
are single-model, single-config; cross-model cost isn't published; and the 10/10
AI suite is self-authored. For the full measurement discipline — per-attempt rate,
Wilson confidence intervals, and why a single solve is an anecdote — see
[Methodology](/methodology/).

## Running the canonical harness

`xsec bench run` is the single benchmark orchestrator. Integrations own only
suite-specific target lifecycle and official grading; every run still produces
the same manifest, attempt receipts, scorecard, tournament, and evidence
contract.

```bash
# Core web/source-audit corpus.
xsec bench run --integration core --variants variants.json

# XBOW: Docker lifecycle + fresh per-attempt flag, scored by the shared oracle.
xsec bench run \
  --integration xbow \
  --xbow-path /path/to/xbow \
  --variants variants.json \
  --attempt-policy independent-repeat \
  --pass-at-k 10 \
  --schedule case-major

# CyberGym: official differential oracle, strict one graded submit per task.
xsec bench run \
  --integration cybergym \
  --cybergym-harness /path/to/cybergym \
  --cybergym-subset results/cybergym-fair-v1.subset.txt \
  --variants variants.json
```

`--attempt-policy pass-at-k` is the default and stops a case after proof.
`independent-repeat` retains every scheduled fresh attempt for a per-attempt
rate. `case-major` interleaves variants by task while keeping Docker and
CyberGym execution serial.

Cybench, npm audit, AutoPenBench, and HarmBench retain their specialized suite
commands until they are migrated through the same integration contract.
