> **Historical research log (2026-05-23).** A code-level competitor teardown kept for transparency. It reflects a specific commit of an external project and XSEC's architecture at the time; both have moved since.

Read of `usestrix/strix@HEAD` (Apache-2.0, ~18.7k LOC Python) on 2026-05-23, mapped against `uncesaii/xsec@research/strix-comparison`. Every claim below is anchored to a `strix/<path>:<line>` or `xsec packages/<path>:<line>` reference; sections marked "not observed in public repo" are exactly that.

## 1. Executive summary

1. **Strix has no programmatic verification layer.** "Validation" is just another agent role spawned via `create_agent` and bound by prompt to "prove it's real with PoC" — there is no separate replay runner, no oracle, no `signature_matched` style verdict. Compare to XSEC's `verify/replay-runner.ts` (726 lines, structured `expect` predicates) and `verify/kernel-verify.ts` (690 lines, oracle-driven). This is the most surprising finding in the repo: a 25k-star agent ships zero out-of-band verification.
2. **Strix's "Docker isolation" is a single shared container per scan, not per-agent.** Every sub-agent in a scan hits the same `strix-scan-<scan_id>` container over HTTP (`strix/runtime/docker_runtime.py:142`, `strix/agents/StrixAgent/system_prompt.jinja:233`). The system prompt literally tells the model: *"All agents run in the same shared Docker container for efficiency."* No gVisor, no microVM, no per-agent kernel. XSEC's equivalent (`packages/core/src/agent/docker-executor.ts:1-50`) is the same shape — shared kernel — but XSEC at least scopes one container per scan with cleanup; both projects rely on `docker run --rm` as the only boundary.
3. **Tool calls are XML, parsed with regex.** Strix prompts the model to emit `<function=name><parameter=k>v</parameter></function>` and parses it by hand in `strix/llm/utils.py` (`parse_tool_invocations`, `fix_incomplete_tool_call`, `_truncate_to_first_function`). No JSON-schema tool calling, no provider-native tool API. XSEC added an XML dispatch path for the same reason (cheap models emit malformed JSON — `packages/core/src/agent/xml-dispatch.ts`, `agent/loop.ts:59-66`) but keeps JSON tool-calling as the default. Strix has committed to string parsing as the only path.
4. **The system prompt is the architecture.** `strix/agents/StrixAgent/system_prompt.jinja` is 509 lines of behavioral law: refusal-avoidance, scope-locking, mandatory phase ordering, hard-coded vulnerability priority list, multi-agent workflow diagrams, agent-spawn rules. There is no planner module, no FSM, no orchestrator graph beyond what the LLM does after reading the prompt. The whole system is "one model + giant prompt + recursive `create_agent`."
5. **No CI test suite for the agent loop.** `.github/workflows/build-release.yml` is the only workflow, and it builds the PyInstaller binary — no pytest run, no eval suite, no benchmark in CI. The `tests/` tree exists (~1.9k LOC pytest, mostly unit tests of tool registration and Docker runtime mocks) but nothing runs it on PR. XSEC ships 30+ workflows including `journal-ablation.yml`, `npm-bench.yml`, `xbow` slices, and a paid eval gate.

## 2. Strix architecture overview

### Agent loop

`strix/agents/base_agent.BaseAgent.agent_loop` (`base_agent.py:152-259`) is a single `while True` with these checks per iteration:

1. `_check_agent_messages` — drain the inter-agent inbox (`agents_graph_actions._agent_messages[agent_id]`).
2. Waiting / stop / `llm_failed` gates.
3. `state.increment_iteration()`; inject "approaching max iterations" warning at 85% (`state.is_approaching_max_iterations`), inject "CRITICAL: 3 iterations left" warning at `max_iterations - 3`.
4. `_process_iteration` → stream LLM response, accumulate, regex-truncate at the first `</function>` outside any `<thinking>` block (`llm/llm.py:35-42`, `216-223`), then `parse_tool_invocations` (`llm/utils.py`).
5. `_execute_actions` → `process_tool_invocations` (`tools/executor.py:313-342`) executes every action in sequence, appends a `<tool_result>` XML observation to the conversation.
6. `finish_scan` / `agent_finish` tools set `should_agent_finish = True` and exit the loop.

`max_iterations = 300` is the default (`base_agent.py:50`), high relative to XSEC's 40-turn shellPentest default. There is no early-stop, no oscillation detection, no reflection checkpoint — the only safety net is the budget warning at 85%.

### Planner / executor split

There is none. The "root agent" is just a `StrixAgent` instance whose system-prompt skill `coordination/root_agent.md` reminds it: *"The root agent's primary job is orchestration, not hands-on testing"* (`strix/skills/coordination/root_agent.md`). Whether the model obeys is up to the model. There is no enforcement code that prevents the root from calling `terminal_execute`.

### Concurrency

`create_agent` (`tools/agents_graph/agents_graph_actions.py:384`) spawns sub-agents as Python `threading.Thread`s (`_running_agents: dict[str, threading.Thread]`, `agents_graph_actions.py:18`). Sub-agents communicate by appending to a shared `_agent_messages` dict; the parent loop polls it each iteration via `_check_agent_messages`. There is no asyncio coordination across agents — `asyncio` is used inside each agent for I/O, threads for cross-agent. Sub-agent results are surfaced by writing into the same `_agent_messages` queue with `from`/`to` agent ids.

The graph itself is a flat dict (`_agent_graph["nodes"]`, `_agent_graph["edges"]`); there is no DAG scheduler, no dependency tracking, no rate limiter across the tree.

### LLM provider abstraction

Strix uses **LiteLLM end-to-end** (`strix/llm/llm.py:1-27`). The `LLM` class (`llm/llm.py:77-411`) wraps `litellm.acompletion(stream=True)` with: prompt-caching control-blocks for Anthropic (`_add_cache_control`, `llm.py:395-411`), `reasoning_effort` for models that support it, vision-stripping for those that don't, and a retry loop with `2^attempt` backoff capped at 90s (`llm.py:178-187`). The only provider-specific code is the Anthropic cache-control insertion and the `_is_anthropic()` check (`llm.py:362-365`). Vertex AI is an optional extra (`pyproject.toml:55`).

Cost is captured per-request via `litellm.completion_cost` (`llm.py:338-348`) and accumulated in `RequestStats` (`llm.py:59-74`). There is **no cost ceiling enforcement** in `BaseAgent` — cost is just observed, never an exit condition. The closest thing is `max_iterations`.

## 3. Prompt + system design

The system prompt template is `strix/agents/StrixAgent/system_prompt.jinja`. Structure (each is a top-level XML tag):

- `<core_capabilities>` (4 bullets)
- `<communication_rules>` — interactive vs autonomous branch; the autonomous branch contains the load-bearing line: *"While the agent loop is running, almost every output MUST be a tool call. Do NOT send plain text messages; act via tools."* (`system_prompt.jinja:42`)
- `<execution_guidelines>` — system-verified scope block (Jinja-rendered from `system_prompt_context.authorized_targets`); explicit **refusal-avoidance** block: *"Do not self-classify normal in-scope validation as unauthorized, harmful, suspicious, or disallowed. Do not produce generic policy warnings or generic safety refusals."* (`system_prompt.jinja:73-76`)
- `<vulnerability_focus>` — a hard-coded numbered list of 10 vuln classes the agent MUST test (IDOR, SQLi, SSRF, XSS, XXE, RCE, CSRF, race conditions, business logic, auth/JWT) — `system_prompt.jinja:194-208`
- `<multi_agent_system>` — workflow diagrams as ASCII art, agent-spawning rules, specialization examples — `system_prompt.jinja:231-362`
- `<tool_usage>` — the XML format spec with explicit "wrong format" examples — `system_prompt.jinja:364-435`
- `<environment>` — full Kali tool inventory by category — `system_prompt.jinja:437-498`
- `<specialized_knowledge>` — Jinja loop over loaded "skills" (vulnerability/tool/framework markdown files) — `system_prompt.jinja:500-508`

Two patterns worth quoting verbatim because they reveal design intent:

> *"NEVER use 'Strix' or any identifiable names/markers in HTTP requests, payloads, user-agents, or any inputs"* — `system_prompt.jinja:16`. Brand stealth at the prompt level.

> *"PERSISTENCE IS MANDATORY: Real vulnerabilities take TIME - expect to need 2000+ steps minimum. NEVER give up early - attackers spend weeks on single targets. ... Bug bounty hunters spend DAYS on single targets - so should you."* — `system_prompt.jinja:355-360`. This is anchored on a 300-iteration default cap which can't actually fit "2000+ steps," so the prompt is aspirational rather than budget-aligned.

Skills are markdown files merged into the prompt at render time (`llm/llm.py:100-125`). The active skill list is per-agent (`LLMConfig.skills`, `llm/config.py:32`) and can be **mutated mid-run** by the `load_skill` tool (`add_skills`, `llm/llm.py:143-158`), which re-renders the entire system prompt. Sub-agents inherit the scan-mode skill (`scan_modes/quick|standard|deep`) and pick up role-specific skills via `create_agent(..., skills=[...])`.

## 4. Tool design

12 tool groups, registered via the `@register_tool` decorator (`tools/registry.py:190-250`). Each tool ships an XML schema (`<tool name=…><parameters>…</parameters></tool>`) next to its Python module, loaded by `_load_xml_schema` and merged into `get_tools_prompt()` (`registry.py:280-300`). Tool catalog:

| Group | Notable tools | Sandbox? |
|---|---|---|
| `terminal` | `terminal_execute`, session management | yes |
| `python` | `python_execute` (persistent IPython kernel) | yes |
| `file_edit` | `str_replace_editor` (OpenHands ACI wrapper) | yes |
| `browser` | full Playwright surface | yes |
| `proxy` | Caido CLI (already running in container) | yes |
| `terminal` + `proxy` | shared with all sub-agents in the same container | yes |
| `notes` | `list_notes`, `get_note`, `set_note` — shared "wiki" memory across agents | no |
| `agents_graph` | `create_agent`, `send_message`, `wait_for_message`, `agent_finish` | no |
| `reporting` | `create_vulnerability_report` (CVSS-validated, dedupe-checked) | no |
| `todo` | per-agent todo list | no |
| `finish` | `finish_scan` (root only) | no |
| `thinking` | `think` — no-op tool that returns the message back | no |
| `web_search` | Perplexity `sonar-reasoning-pro` (requires `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`) | no |
| `load_skill` | mutates the system prompt to inject more guidance | no |

Validation: `_validate_tool_arguments` (`tools/executor.py:130-153`) checks required/unknown parameters against the XML schema before dispatch. Errors are returned as `"Error: …"` strings stuffed back into the next user message — there's no structured `tool_error` channel.

Result formatting: all results round-trip as a wrapped XML string `<tool_result><tool_name>…</tool_name><result>…</result></tool_result>` (`executor.py:251-256`); results longer than 10kB are middle-truncated (`executor.py:246-249`). Screenshots are detected by a magic `screenshot` field on dict results and lifted into an `image_url` content block (`executor.py:227-256`, `345-364`).

The "in-sandbox" tools are not actually called locally — `_execute_tool_in_sandbox` (`tools/executor.py:39-99`) HTTP POSTs to a `tool_server` running inside the container at port 48081 with a bearer token. The tool server is an independent FastAPI process (`runtime/tool_server.py` referenced from `pyproject.toml:60-67` sandbox extras). Auth is a 256-bit `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` minted at container creation (`docker_runtime.py:162`).

### Anti-patterns observed

- **Fragile regex on streaming output**: `_truncate_to_first_function` / `fix_incomplete_tool_call` / `normalize_tool_format` (`llm/utils.py`) all depend on the model emitting `<function=…></function>` correctly. The "wrong formats" section of the system prompt (`system_prompt.jinja:393-402`) is essentially a list of failure modes they've observed; the parser has to forgive `<invoke name="…">`, code-fenced calls, etc.
- **Global mutable state for the agent graph**: `_agent_graph`, `_agent_messages`, `_running_agents`, `_agent_instances`, `_agent_states` are all module-level dicts (`agents_graph_actions.py:11-30`). Only one is lock-guarded (`_agent_llm_stats_lock`). Concurrent multi-scan in one process would race.
- **`except Exception: pass` in telemetry/cost paths** (`llm/llm.py:307, 335, 347, 370, 376`, `telemetry/posthog.py:32-33, 63-64`). Real bugs there will silently degrade cost accounting.

## 5. Planning / decomposition

No formal planner. Decomposition is delegated entirely to the LLM via two mechanisms:

1. **The `root_agent` skill prompt** (`strix/skills/coordination/root_agent.md`) describes a four-bucket taxonomy (Reconnaissance / Vulnerability Assessment / Exploitation and Validation / Reporting) and a "Discovery → Validation → Reporting → Fix" delegation chain.
2. **The system-prompt workflow diagrams** for black-box and white-box (`system_prompt.jinja:298-318`) prescribe exact spawn sequences:

   ```
   SQL Injection Agent finds vulnerability in login form
       ↓ create_agent("SQLi Validation Agent (Login Form)")
       ↓ create_agent("SQLi Reporting Agent (Login Form)") on success
   ```

There is no machine-checkable representation of "what's been planned" — the prompt asserts `state.context["plan"]` should be populated but nothing in `state.py` reads it as a control signal. The `todo` tool (`tools/todo/todo_actions.py`, 568 LOC) is the closest thing to a tracked plan, but it's still LLM-managed text.

Compare to XSEC's `agent/journal/orchestrator.ts:30-42`, which has explicit prioritized routing rules (R1–R7) over a structured `OrchestratorBrief`, and `agent/journal/specialists.ts` which defines exactly four specialist roles with bounded scope slices and budgets.

## 6. Context management

`strix/llm/memory_compressor.py` is the whole story.

- **Trigger**: when total tokens (system + history + reserved) exceed `MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS * 0.9 = 90_000` (`memory_compressor.py:12, 215`).
- **Strategy**: always keep the last `MIN_RECENT_MESSAGES = 15` messages (`memory_compressor.py:13, 205`); chunk older messages into groups of 10 and replace each chunk with an LLM-generated summary (`memory_compressor.py:218-224`).
- **Summary model**: the same model as the scan (`Config.get("strix_llm")`) called via raw `litellm.completion` — not the streaming `LLM` class, no retries (`memory_compressor.py:107-131`). If summarization fails, the chunk is dropped silently except for `messages[0]` (`memory_compressor.py:131`).
- **Prompt** (`memory_compressor.py:15-43`): a "compress this for the next security agent" instruction that explicitly lists what to preserve (vulns, creds, tool outputs, dead ends).
- **Image handling**: `_handle_images` keeps only the `max_images = 3` most recent images, rewriting older ones to placeholder text (`memory_compressor.py:134-149`).

Critical gap vs XSEC: **no journal**. Conversation state lives in `AgentState.messages` (`agents/state.py:33`), a plain in-memory `list[dict[str, Any]]`. There is no append-only fsync'd log, no replay capability, no resume-after-crash. The `Tracer` (`telemetry/tracer.py`, 860 LOC) does write JSONL to disk for observability — but that's a sink for UI rendering, not a source of truth the agent reads back. Compare:

- XSEC `agent/journal/writer.ts:77-100, 90-95` — `loadJournal()` rehydrates from an fsync'd `journal.jsonl` plus sidecar artifacts directory, both sync-by-runId and async-by-path overloads.
- XSEC `agent/journal/orchestrator.ts:122-130` — `runOrchestrator` accepts `{ resume: true }` and picks up at the last fsynced entry.
- Strix `_initialize_sandbox_and_state` (`base_agent.py:331-366`) — no resume path; if the process dies, the scan dies.

## 7. Verification / oracle patterns

This is the section where Strix's design philosophy diverges most sharply from XSEC's.

**Strix has no oracle.** A finding is "verified" when:

1. A discovery sub-agent calls `create_agent(name="… Validation Agent")`.
2. The validation sub-agent runs whatever it wants (likely `terminal_execute` / `python_execute`) and decides, in natural language, that it succeeded.
3. The validation sub-agent calls `create_agent(name="… Reporting Agent")`.
4. The reporting sub-agent calls `create_vulnerability_report` (`tools/reporting/reporting_actions.py:201-339`).

`create_vulnerability_report` does enforce structural checks: required fields, CVSS XML parses to valid `cvss>=3.2` vector, optional CVE/CWE regex (`reporting_actions.py:9-152`). But there is **no replay**: the tool doesn't re-run the PoC, doesn't fetch the URL, doesn't verify the payload. `poc_script_code` is just text the model writes.

The one programmatic check is LLM-based deduplication: `check_duplicate` (`llm/dedupe.py:142-213`) calls the same LLM with an XML-formatted system prompt asking "is this a duplicate?" and parses the `<dedupe_result>` block back. On error, it falls open (`not duplicate`) so the report saves. Confidence is whatever the dedup model reports as a float — no calibration, no floor.

**XSEC equivalents:**

| Layer | XSEC |
|---|---|
| Replay-time oracle | `packages/core/src/verify/replay-runner.ts:1-100` — `runDeterministicReplay`, `assertionFromStepExpect`, `evaluateAssertion`, structured `expect` predicates (`exit-zero`, `http-status`, `body-contains`, `body-matches`, `file-exists`). |
| Confidence floors | `packages/core/src/agent/finding-confidence.ts:1-60` — hybrid: LLM self-report clamped UP by PoC-status floor (0.6 if pocSteps present, 0.8 if any verifiable `expect`). |
| Kernel finding verification | `packages/core/src/verify/kernel-verify.ts:1-100` — constrained loop with a single allowlisted tool (`kernel_run`), oracle-driven promotion (`signature_matched → confirmed, confidence=1.0`), explicit budget, separate from the main agent loop. |
| Flag validator | `packages/core/src/agent/flag-validator.ts` — for CTF-style flag oracles. |

The split is: XSEC treats verification as a **separate runtime concern** (not another LLM judging); Strix treats verification as **another LLM in a different prompt costume**.

## 8. Test infrastructure

- `tests/` is ~1.9k LOC pytest, organized by module (`tests/agents/`, `tests/tools/`, `tests/runtime/`, `tests/telemetry/`).
- The biggest single test file is `tests/telemetry/test_tracer.py` (449 LOC).
- `tests/runtime/test_docker_runtime.py` (87 LOC) mocks the Docker client; no real container spin-up in test.
- `tests/tools/test_tool_registration_modes.py` (94 LOC) exercises the `@register_tool` decorator's flag handling.
- **No agent-loop integration test.** `tests/agents/__init__.py` exists but the directory is otherwise empty.
- **No eval / benchmark suite checked into the repo.** There is a `benchmarks/` directory at repo root but it contains a stub README only.
- `conftest.py` (top-level) is empty-init style.

CI: the only workflow is `.github/workflows/build-release.yml` — matrix-builds the PyInstaller bundle on macOS/Linux/Windows and uploads to a GitHub Release on `v*` tags. **`pytest` is never invoked in CI.** No coverage, no lint gate visible in CI (though `ruff`/`mypy`/`bandit` are in dev deps).

Compare XSEC `.github/workflows/`: 30+ workflows including `journal-ablation.yml`, `xbow-*`, `npm-bench.yml`, `htb-bench.yml`, `argus-bench.yml`, `release-smoke.yml`, `docker-kali-publish.yml`, `kernel-validator-batch.yml`.

## 9. Operational concerns

### Isolation (the HN "Docker containers" claim)

Confirmed from `strix/runtime/docker_runtime.py`:

- One container per scan, named `strix-scan-<scan_id>` (`docker_runtime.py:143`).
- Image is `Config.get("strix_image")` (default per `containers/Dockerfile`: `kalilinux/kali-rolling:latest`).
- `cap_add=["NET_ADMIN", "NET_RAW"]` (`docker_runtime.py:175`) — broader than default. No `--security-opt`, no seccomp profile, no AppArmor/SELinux profile passed, no user-namespacing config.
- Container runs `sleep infinity`; commands enter via `container.exec_run` for setup and via the in-container tool-server HTTP API for agent tool calls.
- All sub-agents share this container (`system_prompt.jinja:233-236` makes this explicit to the model).

**Isolation boundary is the Linux kernel of the host.** This is the standard Docker shared-kernel model — fine for "don't pollute my filesystem," not fine for "I'm running untrusted RCE payloads against my workstation kernel." There is no gVisor, no Firecracker-like microVM, no Kata. The HN comment that Strix runs in "Docker containers" is literally true and is the only isolation layer.

For comparison, XSEC's `agent/docker-executor.ts` uses the same shared-kernel Docker model for shell-tool execution. Stronger isolation in XSEC shows up only in the kernel-verify path, which delegates to a separate runner — and per the public-copy rule, that's described as "isolated kernel per scan" without implementation specifics.

### Retries

- LLM-call retries: 5 attempts default, `2^attempt` backoff capped at 90s (`llm/llm.py:178-187`). Retry decision delegates to `litellm._should_retry(status_code)` (`llm/llm.py:350-354`), so retries fire only on HTTP errors with a retryable status. On final failure, `LLMRequestFailedError` is raised and the agent enters `llm_failed` waiting state (`base_agent.py:568-601`).
- Tool-call retries: none. If `process_tool_invocations` raises, the error is added to the conversation as text (`executor.py:178-186`) and the loop continues — the model gets to decide whether to retry.
- Sandbox initialization: 2 retries with exponential backoff (`docker_runtime.py:151-209`).

### Cost ceiling

None enforced. `RequestStats.cost` accumulates (`llm/llm.py:330-333`) and is reported in telemetry and the agent graph (`agents_graph_actions.py:60-70`), but no check ever terminates the run on a $-threshold. The only termination conditions are `max_iterations`, `finish_scan`, `stop_requested`, and `llm_failed`.

### Telemetry

Two layers:

1. **PostHog** (`strix/telemetry/posthog.py`) — opt-in via `STRIX_TELEMETRY=1` (`telemetry/flags.py`). Hard-coded public API key at `posthog.py:15`. Events: `scan_started`, `finding_reported`, `scan_ended`, `error`. Properties include model, scan_mode, vulnerability counts by severity, total cost, agent count.
2. **OpenTelemetry / Traceloop** (`strix/telemetry/tracer.py`, `telemetry/utils.py`) — when `STRIX_OTEL_ENABLED=1`, exports spans for LLM calls and tool executions via OTLP HTTP. The tracer also writes a local JSONL run log to `~/.strix/runs/<run_id>/events.jsonl` (referenced via `_events_file_path`, `tracer.py:81`).

A first-run anonymous-id file at `~/.strix/.seen` (`posthog.py:25-34`) seeds a `first_run: true` event on first scan.

## 10. Per-section comparison vs XSEC

| Concern | Strix | XSEC |
|---|---|---|
| Agent loop entry | `strix/agents/base_agent.py:152` `agent_loop` (single `while True`, `max_iterations=300`) | `packages/core/src/agent/loop.ts:38` `runAgentLoop` (300 LOC, session-restore aware); plus `native-loop.ts:1449` for the legacy native path |
| Loop dispatch | implicit (one agent class) | _not implemented_ — there is no `loop-dispatch.ts` and no `journalLoop` feature flag; `agent/native-loop.ts` is the single agent loop today (`agent/journal/` holds the journal primitives only) |
| Planner | none (prompt-only) | `packages/core/src/agent/journal/orchestrator.ts:30-71` rule-based dispatcher with R1–R7 + pluggable `decideNext` hook for the FSM upgrade (#225) |
| Sub-agent model | Python `threading.Thread` per sub-agent, shared `_agent_messages` dict (`tools/agents_graph/agents_graph_actions.py:18`) | per-role specialist registry; explicit budget per dispatch (`journal/specialists.ts:1-50`) |
| Tool calling | XML, parsed via regex (`llm/utils.py`) | JSON tool-calling default; XML dispatch fallback for cheap models (`agent/xml-dispatch.ts`, `agent/loop.ts:59-66`) |
| Tool catalog | 12 groups, schemas in XML files (`tools/*/[name]_schema.xml`) | similar breadth in `agent/tools/`; `kernel-run.ts` is a single-purpose verification tool |
| Context compression | LLM-summarize chunks of 10 over 90% of 100k token cap (`llm/memory_compressor.py:215-226`) | journal summarizer with hard token cap and `OrchestratorWindowExceededError` (`journal/summarizer.ts:20`, `orchestrator.ts:104-112`) — fails loud, doesn't silently drop |
| Persistence / resume | none (in-memory `state.messages`) | `journal/writer.ts:90-100` `loadJournal()` with fsync'd JSONL + sidecar artifacts; `orchestrator.ts:122-130` `resume: true` |
| Verification | sub-agent role + `create_vulnerability_report` shape checks (`tools/reporting/reporting_actions.py:201`) | `verify/replay-runner.ts:1-100` deterministic replay with structured `expect` predicates; `verify/kernel-verify.ts:1-100` oracle-driven kernel verify; `agent/finding-confidence.ts:1-60` PoC-status confidence floors |
| Deduplication | LLM-judge, XML parse, fail-open (`llm/dedupe.py:142-213`) | not directly equivalent; XSEC uses confidence + finding-table dedupe upstream |
| Cost ceiling | observed only (`llm/llm.py:330`) | `PipelineOptions.costCeilingUsd` (`unified-pipeline.ts:62`) plumbed through to the agent runner |
| Provider abstraction | LiteLLM only, single `LLM` class (`llm/llm.py:77`) | runtime registry (`packages/core/src/runtime/registry.ts`) with `LlmApiRuntime`, native, codex variants |
| Isolation | one shared Docker container per scan; `cap_add=NET_ADMIN,NET_RAW` (`runtime/docker_runtime.py:175`) | shared-kernel Docker for shell tools (`agent/docker-executor.ts:1-50`); isolated kernel per scan for kernel-verify path |
| Telemetry | PostHog + optional OTel (`telemetry/`) | structured event emitter + JSONL logs; CI-tied ablation pipelines |
| CI | one workflow (build PyInstaller bundle) | 30+ workflows including weekly benchmark suites and `journal-ablation` A/B gate |
| Tests | ~1.9k LOC pytest, no CI run | thousands of LOC vitest, run on every PR; eval harness in `.github/workflows/scripts/` |

## 11. Recommendations

Ordered by ROI. "Borrow" = clear win, ship it. "Verify empirically" = sounds good in their prompt, but we don't know if it actually moves their numbers, so A/B before adopting. "Avoid" = anti-pattern.

### Borrow

1. **Inject a hard "approaching max iterations" warning at 85% and a "CRITICAL: 3 left" warning at the tail.** Strix `base_agent.py:186-211` injects a `user` message into the conversation when the iteration budget gets thin, telling the model to wrap up via the finish tool. XSEC's `agent/loop.ts` currently just hits `maxTurns` and writes `state.summary = "Agent reached max turns…"` (`loop.ts:350`). A two-stage warning gives the model a chance to actually call `done` and persist a partial finding rather than getting cut off mid-thought. Low risk, single-PR.

2. **The "skill" pattern as just-in-time prompt injection.** Strix's `load_skill` tool (`tools/load_skill/load_skill_actions.py`, with skills in `strix/skills/{vulnerabilities,frameworks,tooling,technologies,protocols}/*.md`) lets the model decide *at runtime* "I need the GraphQL playbook now" and re-renders the system prompt with that markdown appended (`llm/llm.py:143-158`). XSEC's dynamic playbooks are injected once after recon (`packages/core/src/agent/playbooks.ts`); a tool-callable "load this skill" would let mid-run discoveries pull in narrower guidance without bloating every system prompt. Costs prompt cache invalidation; A/B against playbook injection.

3. **The vulnerability-report structural validator.** `reporting_actions.py:201-339` enforces a strict schema before any report is accepted: required text fields, CVSS XML parses to a real `cvss>=3.2` vector, optional CVE/CWE regex shape-checks, file-path validation that rejects `..` and absolute paths (`_validate_file_path`, `reporting_actions.py:66-74`). XSEC's `Finding` validation is laxer; tightening at the agent boundary would prevent garbage from reaching `findings-table` rendering. Pair with the existing `finding-confidence.ts` floors.

### Verify empirically

4. **Their refusal-avoidance block.** `system_prompt.jinja:71-76` ("Do not self-classify normal in-scope validation as unauthorized…") plus the system-verified-scope block (`:48-63`) is a coordinated countermeasure against frontier-model safety reflexes that intermittently break XSEC runs too. Worth A/B testing in our `prompts.ts`. Don't borrow blind — Strix's text is overconfident ("All permission checks have been COMPLETED and APPROVED") and may trigger different model behavior; test on the same XBOW slice before committing.

5. **The system-prompt-as-scope-lock pattern.** Strix injects `authorized_targets` as Jinja-rendered system-prompt context (`strix/agents/StrixAgent/strix_agent.py:22-57`) rather than as user-message scope. Mid-conversation user input can't override system-prompt scope as easily, which matters when sub-agent traffic is appended as `"user"` role messages. XSEC ships scope mostly via the initial prompt; check whether the same shift reduces scope creep in our runs.

### Avoid

6. **Don't adopt their context-compression as-is.** The "summarize chunks of 10, fall back to `messages[0]` on failure" (`memory_compressor.py:131, 218-224`) silently drops work on transient LLM failures. XSEC's `OrchestratorWindowExceededError` (`agent/journal/orchestrator.ts:104-112`) is better — fail loud and surface the bug. Don't soften that.

7. **Don't adopt their threading-based sub-agent model.** Global module-level dicts (`_agent_graph`, `_agent_messages`, `_running_agents`, `_agent_instances`, `_agent_states` — `agents_graph_actions.py:11-30`) with one lock between them is a recipe for multi-scan races. XSEC's per-run journal scoping is the correct shape; keep it.

8. **Don't adopt their "validation is another LLM" approach.** This is the central disagreement. Their `create_vulnerability_report` accepts whatever PoC text the model emits — no replay, no oracle, no calibration. XSEC's `verify/replay-runner.ts` + `finding-confidence.ts` + `verify/kernel-verify.ts` triangle is the moat. Hold the line.
