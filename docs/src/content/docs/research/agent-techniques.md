description: Evidence-based techniques for improving autonomous pentesting agents, with implementation details and expected impact.
---

A catalog of every technique we have evaluated for improving XSEC's autonomous pentesting agents. Each entry includes the source evidence, expected impact, implementation status, and enough detail to ship it.

## Shipped Techniques

### 1. Early-Stop + Retry

**What:** If the agent reaches 50% of its turn budget without calling `save_finding`, abort the current attempt and retry with a fresh context and a different strategy prompt. MAPTA data shows successful exploits complete in 15-20 API calls -- if nothing has landed by halfway, the current approach is unlikely to work.

**Source:** MAPTA benchmark analysis; internal A/B testing on XBOW challenges.

**Impact:** Recovers ~15-20% of runs that would otherwise exhaust their full budget on a dead-end approach. The retry gets a clean context window and explicit instruction to try a different vector.

**Implementation:** `packages/core/src/agent/native-loop.ts` -- the `NativeAgentState` type carries `earlyStopNoProgress` and `attemptSummary` fields. The main loop checks at each turn whether `turnCount >= floor(maxTurns / 2)` and `!saveFindingCalled` and `retryCount === 0`. When triggered, the loop breaks and the caller (`packages/core/src/agentic-scanner.ts`) launches a second `runNativeAgentLoop` with `retryCount: 1`, a rewritten system prompt emphasizing a different strategy, and the remaining turn budget. Results from both attempts are merged.

**Key details:**
- Only fires for `role === "attack"` with `maxTurns >= 10` (below that, overhead is not worth it).
- The retry system prompt includes `attemptSummary` so the second attempt knows what already failed.
- `retryCount: 1` disables early-stop on the second attempt to avoid infinite retry chains.

---

### 2. Exploit Script Templates

**What:** Inject ready-made exploit script patterns directly into the system prompt so the agent can copy-paste and adapt them instead of writing from scratch. Covers blind SQLi timing extraction, SSTI-to-RCE chains (Jinja2), and multi-step auth with cookie jars.

**Source:** MAPTA benchmark (0% success on blind SQLi without templates); internal testing showing agents waste 5-8 turns reinventing timing scripts.

**Impact:** Blind SQLi goes from 0% to solvable. SSTI exploitation drops from ~6 turns of trial-and-error to 2 (detect + RCE payload). Auth chains go from frequent cookie-loss failures to reliable first-attempt success.

**Implementation:** `packages/core/src/agent/prompts.ts` -- the `shellPentestPrompt()` function includes a "Script Patterns" section with three templates:

| Template | Trigger | What it does |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Blind SQLi timing | Any blind injection scenario | Python script with `requests` + `time.time()` to extract characters via `SLEEP`/`IF` |
| SSTI to RCE | `{{7*7}}` returns 49 | Jump straight to `__import__('os').popen('cat /flag*').read()` |
| Multi-step auth | Login form present | `curl -c /tmp/jar -b /tmp/jar` chain: login, IDOR probe, path traversal |

**Key details:**
- Templates use `$TARGET` env var (set by the runner) so they work without URL hardcoding.
- The blind SQLi template iterates positions 1-64 and ASCII 32-127, printing characters as found.
- SSTI template skips the gradual escalation (`config`, `config.items()`, etc.) and goes directly to RCE -- the detection step already confirmed the vulnerability class.

---

### 3. Loop / Oscillation Detection

**What:** Track the last 12 tool call fingerprints (name + first 100 chars of arguments). Detect two patterns: A-A-A (same command 3x in a row) and A-B-A-B (two commands alternating for 2+ cycles). When detected, inject a warning message into the conversation. Each pattern signature fires at most once to avoid warning spam.

**Source:** BoxPwnr (97.1% on XBOW). Their analysis showed agents commonly enter repeat loops that consume 30-50% of the budget.

**Impact:** Breaks loops within 1 turn of detection. Saves 3-8 turns per affected run. Estimated ~5% overall solve rate improvement.

**Implementation:** `packages/core/src/agent/native-loop.ts` -- the `LoopDetector` class.

```typescript
// Fingerprint: tool name + first 100 chars of JSON args
// Window: last 12 entries (windowSize * 2)
// Pattern 1: fp(n) === fp(n-1) === fp(n-2)
// Pattern 2: fp(n-3) === fp(n-1) && fp(n-2) === fp(n) && fp(n-3) !== fp(n-2)
```

**Key details:**
- `firedPatterns` set prevents the same pattern signature from triggering twice. This is important -- repeated warnings cause the agent to fixate on the warning itself.
- The warning text instructs a "COMPLETELY DIFFERENT approach" rather than a minor variation, which testing showed is more effective at breaking the cycle.
- History is bounded to `windowSize * 2 = 12` entries to keep memory constant.

---

### 4. Context Compaction (LLM-based, multi-recompaction)

**What:** When input tokens exceed the threshold, summarize the middle of the conversation via a single LLM call to a structured "findings / credentials / endpoints / failed approaches" format, then splice the summary back into the conversation in place of the middle messages. The system prompt / initial message and the last 8 messages are preserved verbatim; messages containing critical patterns (credentials, flags, findings) are also pinned verbatim. Unlike the original regex-only version, the current implementation uses an LLM for the summary and allows **multiple recompactions** during a single run — the `contextCompacted` flag has been replaced with a compaction counter so long sessions stay under the limit.

**Source:** BoxPwnr (60% context threshold triggers compaction); CHAP paper (NDSS 2026) documenting context window degradation in long agent sessions.

**Impact:** Prevents context window overflow that causes hallucinations and instruction-following degradation in turns 20+. BoxPwnr attributes part of their 97.1% XBOW score to this technique.

**Implementation:** `packages/core/src/agent/native-loop.ts` -- the `compactMessages()` function and supporting helpers.

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `CRITICAL_PATTERNS` | 14 regexes matching credentials, flags, tokens, keys, secrets |
| `SUMMARY_EXTRACT_PATTERNS` | 13 regexes extracting URLs, IPs, HTTP status codes, file paths, error keywords |
| `isCriticalMessage()` | Tests a message against all critical patterns |
| `extractKeyFindings()` | Scans all middle messages, extracts matching lines, deduplicates, caps at 80 entries |
| `compactMessages()` | Rebuilds conversation: first message + assistant ack + summary + critical messages + tail 8 |

**Key details:**
- Multiple recompactions allowed per session (counter-based, not the old one-shot flag) so long sessions stay under the token budget.
- Role alternation is maintained after compaction (user/assistant/user/...) to satisfy the API contract.
- The summary is inserted as a user message so the model treats it as ground truth, not its own prior reasoning.
- `save_finding` calls found in the middle are preserved verbatim in the summary (not just the regex-extracted lines).

### 5. Dynamic Vulnerability Playbooks — SHIPPED

**What:** After the initial recon phase, pattern-match tool-result text against a library of per-vulnerability playbooks and inject the best 1–3 matches into the conversation as a focused cheat-sheet. 21 playbooks are in the library: `sqli`, `structural_sqli`, `ssti`, `idor`, `access_control`, `xss`, `ssrf`, `lfi`, `auth_bypass`, `blind_exploitation`, `cve_exploitation`, `command_injection`, `deserialization`, `request_smuggling`, `creative_idor`, `prompt_injection`, `rag_poisoning`, `insecure_output_handling`, `excessive_agency`, `prompt_layer_write`, `rust_memsafety`.

**Source:** CurriculumPT; Cyber-AutoAgent's self-rewriting prompts (this is the simpler cousin).

**Impact:** Measured on XSEC's XBOW runs, the XSS playbook alone cracked previously-unsolved XBEN-011 and XBEN-018.

**Implementation:** `packages/core/src/agent/playbooks.ts` — exports `PLAYBOOKS` (keyed by vuln type), `detectPlaybooks(toolResultTexts)` (pattern matcher, caps at 3 playbooks to avoid prompt bloat), and `buildPlaybookInjection(types)`. Feature flag: `XSEC_FEATURE_DYNAMIC_PLAYBOOKS`.

---

### 6. EGATS — Evidence-Gated Attack Tree Search — SHIPPED

**What:** Model the attack as a tree where each node is a hypothesis ("SQLi via /login username param"). A mini agent loop runs at each node to gather evidence, the evidence is scored against the hypothesis (0-1), and only branches whose evidence exceeds a threshold are expanded. Beam search keeps the top-K branches per level. The tree terminates when a flag is found, all branches die, or max depth is reached.

**Source:** MAPTA paper (arXiv:2508.20816); EGATS adapted from code-generation tree-search literature.

**Impact:** Expected +5-9pp on targets with large attack surfaces. Generalises XSEC's early-stop mechanism: early-stop gates a single linear run, EGATS gates every branch.

**Implementation:** `packages/core/src/agent/egats.ts` — `AttackNode`, `EGATSConfig`, `scoreEvidence`, `hasFlag`, `runEGATS`, `runEGATSWithDefaults`, `summariseTree`. Feature flag: `XSEC_FEATURE_EGATS`.

---

### 7. Best-of-N Strategy Racing — SHIPPED

**What:** Run the same target with multiple different attack strategies in parallel, take the first one that finds a vulnerability. Inspired by BoxPwnr running ~10 solver configs in parallel. Default strategies include `aggressive`, `methodical`, `creative`, with different system-prompt overrides, models, turn budgets, and temperature hints.

**Source:** BoxPwnr; Pass@N vs Pass@1 gap analysis.

**Impact:** +5-8 flags at 3x cost. Converts probabilistic solves into reliable ones.

**Implementation:** `packages/core/src/racing.ts` — `AttackStrategy`, `RaceConfig`, `StrategyResult`, `RaceResult`, `DEFAULT_STRATEGIES`, `raceStrategies`.

---

### 8. Progress Handoff Between Attempts — SHIPPED

**What:** When retrying (after early-stop or failure), the prior attempt's structured progress — discovered endpoints, credentials, confirmed vulns, failed approaches, tech stack — is injected into the new session as a "Prior Attempt Results" section. Richer than the original single-line `attemptSummary`.

**Source:** BoxPwnr's `{{ progress_content }}` template variable.

**Impact:** Observed conversion of roughly 20% of retries into successes.

**Implementation:** Progress extraction lives in `packages/core/src/agent/native-loop.ts`; injection happens in `packages/core/src/agentic-scanner.ts` when building the retry prompt. Feature flag: `XSEC_FEATURE_PROGRESS_HANDOFF`.

---

## Not Yet Implemented

### Context Relay / Cognitive Refresh

**What:** Full context reset with a structured handoff summary generated by an LLM call. Unlike compaction (technique 4), this starts an entirely new conversation. The current session is summarized into a structured handoff document (discovered endpoints, confirmed vulns, credentials, failed approaches), then a fresh agent session is initialized with that summary as its starting context.

**Source:** CHAP paper (NDSS 2026); Cyber-AutoAgent architecture.

**Impact:** CHAP reports this as their primary technique for solving challenges that require 40+ turns. Expected +5-10% on long-running scans.

**Implementation sketch:**
- Add a `generateHandoffSummary(state: NativeAgentState): Promise<string>` function that makes a single LLM call with the full conversation and a structured extraction prompt (endpoints, creds, findings, failed approaches, next steps).
- In `runNativeAgentLoop`, trigger at ~70% budget if `!saveFindingCalled` (later threshold than early-stop since this is more expensive).
- Start a new `runNativeAgentLoop` with the handoff summary prepended to the initial user message.
- Different from early-stop retry: this preserves accumulated knowledge via LLM summarization rather than just `attemptSummary`.

**Location:** `packages/core/src/agent/native-loop.ts` (new function + trigger logic). **Difficulty:** Medium. Requires one extra LLM call (~2k tokens) per relay.

---

### Evidence-Gated Branching

**What:** Before committing turns to exploitation, verify preconditions: does the endpoint exist? Is auth required? Is the parameter actually injectable? Structure the agent's approach as: recon (2-3 turns) -> precondition checks (1-2 turns) -> exploitation (remaining turns). Don't waste turns on UNION SELECT if the parameter is not even reflected in the response.

**Source:** MAPTA framework. Their analysis shows agents waste 30-40% of turns on exploitation attempts where preconditions are not met.

**Impact:** Expected +5-8pp by redirecting wasted exploitation turns to viable attack paths.

**Implementation sketch:**
- Add a precondition check phase to `buildContinuePrompt()` at ~20% budget. Inject a message: "Before exploiting, confirm: (1) endpoint responds, (2) parameter is reflected/processed, (3) no WAF blocking. List confirmed preconditions, then proceed."
- Alternatively, implement as a structured check in the loop: after turn 3, parse the conversation for confirmed endpoints and inject a "precondition summary" message.
- Lighter version: add precondition language to the `shellPentestPrompt` attack instructions (e.g., "Before running a SQLi UNION chain, first confirm the parameter is injectable with `' OR 1=1--` and check for SQL error messages").

**Location:** `packages/core/src/agent/prompts.ts` (prompt changes) or `native-loop.ts` (structured check). **Difficulty:** Low for prompt-only version, Medium for structured check.

---

### Self-Rewriting Prompts

**What:** Every 20 turns, the agent pauses to analyze what has worked and what has failed in the current session, then rewrites its own system prompt guidance. Protected critical sections (authorization scope, tool definitions, output format) cannot be modified. Only the strategy/approach sections are rewritable.

**Source:** Cyber-AutoAgent. Jumped from 46% to 84% on their benchmark.

**Impact:** Expected +10-15pp on long sessions (30+ turns). Less impactful on short sessions where early-stop + retry handles the strategy pivot.

**Implementation sketch:**
- Split the system prompt into `PROTECTED` and `REWRITABLE` sections using delimiters.
- At turn 20 (and every 20 turns after), inject a meta-prompt: "Analyze your last 20 turns. What worked? What failed? Rewrite your attack strategy. Output a JSON block with key `revised_strategy`."
- Parse the agent's response for the JSON block, splice it into the `REWRITABLE` section, and continue.
- Guard rails: max rewrite length (500 tokens), regex validation that protected sections are unchanged, rollback if the rewrite is empty or malformed.

**Location:** `packages/core/src/agent/native-loop.ts` (new reflection checkpoint in main loop). **Difficulty:** Medium. The tricky part is parsing the rewrite reliably from the agent's output.

---

### External Working Memory

**What:** The agent writes its plan, discovered credentials, and current state to `/tmp/plan.json` via bash commands. At reflection checkpoints (every 5-10 turns), the file is read back and injected into the conversation. This prevents the "credential forgetting" problem where the agent discovers a password early, then fails to use it 15 turns later because it has scrolled out of the effective context window.

**Source:** TermiAgent. Their ablation shows -67% success rate without external working memory.

**Impact:** Expected +10-15pp on challenges requiring multi-step exploitation with credentials or session tokens.

**Implementation sketch:**
- Add to `shellPentestPrompt`: "After discovering ANY credential, endpoint, or important finding, write it to /tmp/plan.json using bash. Format: `echo '{\"creds\": [...], \"endpoints\": [...], \"plan\": \"...\"}' > /tmp/plan.json`"
- In `native-loop.ts`, at every 5th turn, inject a user message: "Review your working memory. Run: `cat /tmp/plan.json` and update your plan based on current progress."
- The agent naturally maintains this file through bash -- no new tools or infrastructure needed.
- Alternative (lower-effort): at reflection checkpoints, automatically run `cat /tmp/plan.json` via the tool executor and inject the result. This ensures the memory is always refreshed even if the agent forgets to read it.

**Location:** `packages/core/src/agent/prompts.ts` (prompt addition), `packages/core/src/agent/native-loop.ts` (reflection checkpoint injection). **Difficulty:** Low. Leverages existing bash tool.

---

### RAG from Prior Solves

**What:** Build a patterns database from successful exploit runs. When starting a new challenge, match the target's characteristics (tech stack, response patterns, endpoint structure) against prior solutions using keyword overlap. Inject the top 3 matching prior solutions as hints in the system prompt.

**Source:** General RAG-for-agents literature; internal observation that agents re-derive the same exploit chains across similar challenges.

**Impact:** Expected +5-10pp on benchmarks with recurring vulnerability patterns (XBOW has many similar challenges). Diminishing returns as the agent's base capability improves.

**Implementation sketch:**
- Create `packages/core/src/agent/patterns-db.ts`:
  ```typescript
  interface SolvePattern {
    id: string;
    techStack: string[];         // ["Flask", "Jinja2", "SQLite"]
    vulnTypes: string[];         // ["SSTI", "SQLi"]
    keyPayloads: string[];       // ["{{7*7}}", "' UNION SELECT..."]
    exploitChain: string;        // "Detect SSTI via {{7*7}} -> escalate to RCE -> cat /flag"
    turnCount: number;
    keywords: string[];          // for matching
  }
  ```
- After each successful scan (flag extracted), persist a `SolvePattern` to SQLite.
- On new scan start, run `matchPatterns(reconOutput: string): SolvePattern[]` using TF-IDF or simple keyword overlap scoring against the patterns DB.
- Inject top 3 matches into the system prompt: "Similar challenges were solved with these approaches: ..."

**Location:** New file `packages/core/src/agent/patterns-db.ts`, integration in `agentic-scanner.ts` (before attack phase). **Difficulty:** Medium. Requires a persistence layer and matching algorithm. Could start with a simple JSON file and keyword overlap before investing in proper vector search.
