description: Where XSEC's XBOW score comes from, its caveats, and what the benchmark does and doesn't tell you.
---

XBOW is a useful web-CTF substrate, but a benchmark score is not the product. The
proof we care about is real, disclosed CVEs. This page explains how XSEC's XBOW number is built and where its limits are, so the
figure can be read honestly rather than as a leaderboard trophy.

## How XSEC scores on XBOW, and the caveats

**Headline: 93 / 95 = 97.9% black-box on the gpt-5.4 model-specific cohort.**
Across the 95 XBOW challenges where XSEC has a retained gpt-5.4 attempt within the
live CI window, 93 are solved, at ~$0.48/run and $5.20/flag. We lead with the
per-model number because it is a stable single-model solve rate, not a best-of-N
union over an aging artifact window.

Caveats to keep attached to that number:

- **Single model, single-shot.** The cohort is one model (Azure gpt-5.4) with a
  fixed feature stack and targeted retries, not a multi-model ensemble.
- **A wider retained-artifact aggregate exists but is rotation-volatile.** GitHub
  Actions retains only a 90-day window of run artifacts, so older "unknown"-model
  proofs age out as new sweeps land. The aggregate is real but should not be the
  headline; the per-model cohort is the defensible surface.
- **CTF ≠ real repo.** XBOW challenges are small, single-vuln web apps with a
  planted flag. Solving them says the pipeline works; it says nothing about
  finding a novel bug in a million-line kernel tree.
- **Cross-project scores aren't matched-conditions.** Fork, turn cap, and retry
  protocol all move the number by several points. See [Methodology](/methodology/).

The exact retained-artifact vs. historical-publication distinction and the
challenge-set mismatch live on the [Benchmark](/benchmark/) page and in the
benchmark ledger.

## Where the remaining gaps are

At the retained-artifact layer the unsolved set is small, and clusters into a few
recurring problem types rather than a single systemic weakness:

| Class | Why it's still hard |
|-------|---------------------|
| Hard XSS | Browser-oracle usage still lags the best specialized agents. |
| Blind SSTI / deep exploit chains | Evidence is weak early, so budget gets spent proving exploitability. |
| Complex stateful auth workflows | Multi-step auth chains still degrade reliability. |
| Long-horizon exploit planning | Remaining tasks punish retries that don't materially pivot. |

## Design decisions the benchmark validated

Working against XBOW informed several parts of the harness that also carry over to
real-target scanning:

- **Shell-first.** A `bash` tool plus a tiny result/save interface outperforms
  structured HTTP wrappers — the agent uses curl, python3, and real tools directly.
- **Plan then execute, with reflection checkpoints.** The agent writes a brief
  attack plan before touching the target and is prompted to reassess at ~60% of its
  turn budget rather than repeating a failing approach.
- **Turn budget.** Deep mode runs 40 tool calls with LLM-based context compaction
  (effectively more via re-compaction), in line with published findings that ~40
  calls is the practical sweet spot.
- **Concurrent subagents.** XSEC now ships `spawn_agents`: the lead agent can fan
  out focused children concurrently (bounded fan-out, default concurrency 4) and a
  child can coordinate with its parent. This is a real capability the harness uses.
- **White-box mode.** `--repo <path>` gives the agent source alongside `bash`, which
  lifts the ceiling on challenges with no web-facing vector (e.g. credentials
  hardcoded in source). CI runs black-box and white-box independently.

## Framework vs. model

Much of the score comes from getting the framework out of the model's way — a small
tool surface, a lean prompt, and letting the model's training do the work. But the
framework is doing real load-bearing work too: scope enforcement, context
compaction, loop detection, concurrent subagent fan-out, retry/handoff, and the
separate blind-verify step that decides which findings survive. The scaffolding is
where reliability, safety, and reproducibility come from — the parts that matter far
more on a real target than on a CTF flag hunt.

## Other benchmarks in scope

Beyond XBOW, these are relevant to XSEC's capabilities and are wired or planned:

| Benchmark | Domain | Scale | XSEC relevance |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------------|
| [Cybench](https://github.com/andyzorigin/cybench) | Broad CTF (web/crypto/pwn/rev) | 40 challenges | Scored: 36/40 = 90.0% single-config |
| [AutoPenBench](https://github.com/lucagioacchini/auto-pen-bench) | Network / CVE pentesting | 33 Docker tasks | Harness built; shell-first maps to its `execute_bash` |
| [HarmBench](https://github.com/centerforaisafety/HarmBench) | LLM red-teaming | 510 behaviors | Lightweight `sendPrompt()` harness |
| npm audit (self-published) | Package auditing | 81 packages | F1 = 0.973; see [ablation log](/research/2026-04-11-ablation/) |
