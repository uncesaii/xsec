title: Feature Extractor
description: Reference for the 55 handcrafted finding-triage features exposed by extractFeatures() and FEATURE_NAMES.
---

`packages/core/src/triage/feature-extractor.ts` exports a 55-element numeric
vector used as a fast first-pass triage signal:

- `extractFeatures(finding): number[]`
- `FEATURE_NAMES: string[]`

The extractor is intentionally cheap:

- pure regex and string operations
- no LLM calls
- no network requests
- no external scanners

It is the handcrafted half of XSEC's VulnBERT-inspired hybrid direction.

## Why it exists

VulnBERT's reported ablations are the key reference point:

| Model family | Recall | False positive rate |
|--------------|--------|---------------------|
| Handcrafted features alone | 76.8% | 15.9% |
| CodeBERT alone | 84.3% | 4.2% |
| Hybrid features + neural fusion | 92.2% | 1.2% |

XSEC uses the handcrafted layer today because it is deterministic,
explainable, and cheap enough to run before any paid verification.

## Group breakdown

| Group | Count | Indices |
|------|-------|---------|
| Response features | 13 | `0-12` |
| Request features | 10 | `13-22` |
| Metadata features | 8 | `23-30` |
| Text quality features | 10 | `31-40` |
| Cross-field features | 4 | `41-44` |
| Kernel crash features | 10 | `45-54` |

### Metadata features

| Idx | Name | Type | Range | Rationale |
|-----|------|------|-------|-----------|
| 23 | `meta_severity_ordinal` | int | `0-4` | Encodes severity as an ordinal prior |
| 24 | `meta_confidence` | float | `0-1` typical | Carries the agent's own confidence into triage |

| 30 | `meta_has_cve` | bool | `0/1` | CVE references often indicate external corroboration |

### Text quality features

| Idx | Name | Type | Range | Rationale |
|-----|------|------|-------|-----------|
| 31 | `text_description_length` | int | `0+` | Very short descriptions often correlate with low-quality findings |
| 32 | `text_repro_steps` | bool | `0/1` | Reproduction steps are a strong signal of finding quality |
| 33 | `text_impact_statement` | bool | `0/1` | Explicit impact reasoning raises trust in the finding |
| 34 | `text_hedging_language` | bool | `0/1` | Hedging often correlates with weak or speculative findings |
| 35 | `text_verification_language` | bool | `0/1` | "confirmed", "verified", "reproduced" are strong positive cues |
| 36 | `text_analysis_length` | int | `0+` | Richer analysis text often means a more grounded claim |
| 37 | `text_code_blocks` | bool | `0/1` | Embedded code or PoC snippets raise exploit credibility |
| 38 | `text_evidence_request_nonempty` | bool | `0/1` | Missing request evidence is a major weakness |

### Cross-field features

| 44 | `cross_evidence_completeness` | float | `0-1` | Non-empty request / response / analysis count divided by 3 |

### Kernel crash features

Added for kernel-target findings (xverse), where the signal lives in the crash
report rather than an HTTP request/response. Zero-valued on web findings, so the
same 55-D vector serves both domains.

| Idx | Name | Type | Range | Rationale |
|-----|------|------|-------|-----------|
| 45 | `kernel_crash_type_ordinal` | float | `0+` | Crash class encoded as an ordinal (UAF/OOB/etc.) — different classes carry different exploitability priors |
| 46 | `kernel_stack_depth` | float | `0+` | Call-stack depth of the crash — shallow, reproducible stacks are easier to triage |
| 47 | `kernel_has_reproducer` | bool | `0/1` | A syz/C reproducer is attached — the strongest single exploitability signal |
| 48 | `kernel_access_is_write` | bool | `0/1` | The faulting access is a write (vs read) — write primitives are more exploitable |
| 49 | `kernel_access_size` | float | `0+` | Size of the faulting access |
| 50 | `kernel_network_subsystem` | bool | `0/1` | Crash is in a network subsystem — remotely reachable surface |
| 51 | `kernel_has_alloc_site` | bool | `0/1` | Allocation site is known (memory-corruption triage) |
| 52 | `kernel_has_free_site` | bool | `0/1` | Free site is known (UAF triage) |
| 53 | `kernel_is_kasan` | bool | `0/1` | KASAN-reported — a sanitizer-confirmed memory bug |
| 54 | `kernel_subsystem_criticality` | float | `0-1` | Criticality weight of the affected subsystem |

## How features are chosen

The features deliberately mix six signal families:

- response evidence
- request payload shape
- metadata priors
- text-quality heuristics
- cross-field consistency
- kernel crash-report signals (xverse targets)

That split reflects how triage actually works in practice: a finding is not
credible because any one field looks good, but because several independent
signals line up.

## Fusion with neural models

The extractor is meant to pair with text embeddings, not replace them.

The natural hybrid shape is:

1. `text` -> encoder embedding
2. `features` -> linear projection
3. fusion head over both representations
4. binary TP/FP classifier

That is the same broad architecture family referenced from
[Finding Triage ML](/research/finding-triage-ml/).

## Domain-transfer caveat

These features are strongest on web and exploit-style findings because many
of them look for:

- reflected payloads
- status codes
- stack traces
- SQL errors
- request / response evidence density

On npm supply-chain findings, many of those fields are sparse or zero. That
is not a bug in the extractor; it is a real domain-transfer limitation and
exactly the kind of thing a paper should report honestly.

## Reproducibility

- deterministic
- source available
- pure local computation
- no model calls
- no network dependence

That makes the feature vector suitable for ablations, baselines, and
air-gapped experimentation.
