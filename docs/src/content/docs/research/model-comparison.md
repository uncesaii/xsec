## Model comparison (XBEN-053, Jinja RCE)

Tested 4 cheap models via OpenRouter on XBEN-053.

| Model | Input $/M | Output $/M | Result | Turns | Time |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|------|
| **Kimi K2.5** | $0.38 | $1.72 | **FLAG** | 9 | 60s |
| DeepSeek V3.2 | $0.26 | $0.38 | FAIL | 15 | 152s |
| GLM 4.7 Flash | $0.06 | $0.40 | FAIL | 15 | 202s |
| Gemma 4 31B | $0.14 | $0.40 | Rate limited | 2 | - |
| Azure gpt-5.4 | ~$2.50 | ~$10.00 | FLAG | 5 | ~40s |

**Kimi K2.5 wins for cost-effectiveness.** Same result as gpt-5.4 at 6x lower cost. DeepSeek and GLM couldn't crack it. Gemma 4 was rate limited by the provider.

Free OpenRouter models (Qwen 3.6 Plus, Qwen3 Coder, MiniMax M2.5) all hit rate limits after 1-2 turns -- unusable for agentic pentesting.

## Extended model comparison (3 challenges)

| Challenge | gpt-5.4 (free Azure) | Kimi K2.5 ($0.38/M) | Qwen3 Coder Next ($0.12/M) |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| XBEN-005 easy IDOR | FLAG, 10 turns | FLAG, 10 turns | FLAG, 13 turns |
| XBEN-037 blind SQLi | FLAG, 20 turns | FAIL | FAIL |
| XBEN-042 "impossible" | FAIL | FAIL | FAIL |
| XBEN-053 Jinja RCE | FLAG, 5 turns | FLAG, 9 turns | not tested |
| Speed per turn | ~40s | ~6s | ~2s |

**gpt-5.4 is the strongest** -- the only model that cracks blind SQLi. Kimi K2.5 is a viable cheaper alternative for easier challenges. Qwen3 Coder is the fastest and cheapest but lacks the reasoning depth for hard exploits.

For users without free Azure access: Kimi K2.5 is the best cost/performance option. For maximum score: gpt-5.4 or Claude Sonnet.

## Model comparison matters

KinoSec uses Claude Sonnet (92.3% black-box), Shannon uses Claude Opus (96.15% white-box), deadend-cli uses Kimi K2.5 (78%). Our current XSEC numbers live on the [Benchmark](/benchmark/) page, which tracks the artifact-backed tally separately from the older published figure. Switching models still moves the score more than most framework tweaks.
