title: FP Reduction Moat
description: Measured behavior of XSEC's 11-layer triage pipeline across benchmark slices, plus layer-by-layer implementation notes and references.
---

> **Update 2026-04-12:** This page reflects the 21-profile ablation and follow-up reruns after EGATS was removed from default moat aliases. The measured effect remains slice-dependent: strong on XBOW black-box, a precision/recall trade on XBOW white-box, and variance-sensitive on npm-bench at current sample size. See the [2026-04-11 ablation results log](/research/2026-04-11-ablation/) for full tables and caveats, [XSEC#72](https://github.com/uncesaii/xsec/issues/72) for run tracking, and [XSEC#116](https://github.com/uncesaii/xsec/issues/116) for the EGATS profile change.

XSEC's triage pipeline is a stack of independent filters, each tuned for a different failure mode. Every layer is open-source, every layer is toggleable via feature flags, and each layer is represented in benchmarked profiles. This page documents measured outcomes, implementation details, and configuration surfaces.

The [Triage Dataset](/research/triage-dataset/) and [Feature Extractor](/research/feature-extractor/) pages document the new data foundation directly. The [Architecture](/architecture/) page shows how the triage stage slots into the overall pipeline.

## Measured results — 2026-04-11 ablation

The headline numbers from the 21-run ablation matrix dispatched on 2026-04-11. Every profile below is defined in `.github/workflows/xbow-bench.yml` and is reproducible via `gh workflow run xbow-bench.yml -f features=<profile>`.

### XBOW white-box, limit=50 (4 profiles)

| Profile | Flags | Findings | Cost | $/flag |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `none` (all triage off) | 43/50 (86%) | 67 | $14.34 | $0.33 |
| `no-triage` (defaults minus always-on gates) | **44/50** (88%) | 67 | $17.17 | $0.39 |
| `moat-only` (moat layers, stable features off) | 41/50 (82%) | **25** | $26.89 | $0.66 |
| `moat` (everything on) | 41/50 (82%) | **25** | $21.82 | $0.53 |

**Interpretation.** Turning on the full 11-layer moat *cuts findings by 63%* (67 → 25), *loses 2 flags* (44 → 41), and *costs 1.6× more per flag*. This is a Pareto tradeoff.

Note that `moat` and `moat-only` produce identical flag count and finding count. The stable features (early_stop, loop_detection, context_compaction, script_templates, progress_handoff) don't change the outcome when stacked on top of the moat layers.

### XBOW black-box, limit=25 (4 profiles)

| Profile | Flags | Findings | Cost | $/flag |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `none` | 18/25 (72%) | 27 | $13.72 | $0.76 |
| `no-triage` | 19/25 (76%) | 34 | $10.37 | $0.55 |
| `moat-only` | 18/25 (72%) | **13** | $11.22 | $0.62 |
| **`moat`** | **19/25** (76%) | 14 | **$10.04** | **$0.53** |

**Interpretation.** On this black-box slice, `moat` dominates `none`: more flags, fewer findings, and lower cost per flag.

### npm-bench (5 profiles)

| Profile | F1 | TPR (recall) | FPR | Malicious | Vulnerable | Safe |
|---|---:|---:|---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **`none`** | **0.973** | 1.00 | **0.11** | 27/27 | 27/27 | 24/27 |
| `no-triage` | 0.964 | 1.00 | 0.15 | 27/27 | 27/27 | 23/27 |
| `moat-only` | 0.964 | 1.00 | 0.15 | 27/27 | 27/27 | 23/27 |
| `moat` | 0.956 | 1.00 | 0.19 | 27/27 | 27/27 | 22/27 |
| `default` | 0.956 | 1.00 | 0.19 | 27/27 | 27/27 | 22/27 |

**Interpretation (batch 1).** `default` and `moat` are identical on this run. Batch-1 attribution suggested the FPR shift from `none` to `default` came from stable features. Follow-up reruns showed meaningful variance, so this attribution should be treated as provisional until repeated runs are available.

Also worth noting: **100% TPR across every profile.** Every malicious package and every vulnerable package in the 81-package set is caught regardless of which triage layers are on. The earlier `npm-bench-latest.json` snapshot showing F1=0.444 was on a different 30-package slice and no longer reflects reality — see [XSEC#111](https://github.com/uncesaii/xsec/issues/111).

### Single-feature isolation on stubborn-14 (white-box)

To figure out which moat layer causes the flag losses in white-box, each one was added to the `default` profile individually on a 14-challenge "stubborn slice" (challenges the baseline already fails on). Comparison point is a same-day `wb-default-ref` run.

| Profile | Flags | Δ vs default | Cost | $/flag |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `wb-default-ref` | 2/14 | — (baseline) | $7.24 | $3.62 |
| `feat-pov` | 4/14 | **+2** | $9.56 | $2.39 |
| **`feat-reach`** | **5/14** | **+3** | **$8.04** | **$1.61** |
| `feat-multi` | 3/14 | +1 | $7.55 | $2.52 |
| `feat-debate` | 5/14 | **+3** | $13.26 | $2.65 |
| `feat-mem` | 4/14 | +2 | $13.40 | $3.35 |
| **`feat-egats`** | **1/14** | **−1** | **$15.93** | **$15.93** |
| `feat-cons` | 3/14 | +1 | $8.01 | $2.67 |

**Per-layer signal.** Every moat layer except `egats` is net-neutral-to-positive individually. `egats` is the regressing layer in this isolation run: lower flags than baseline and much higher cost per flag.

`feat-reach` is the clear winner: +3 flags at $1.61 per flag, less than half the cost of the default baseline.

`egats` has been flagged for disable-by-default in [XSEC#116](https://github.com/uncesaii/xsec/issues/116).

### Takeaways

1. **No single static policy wins on all three slices.** The moat helps on black-box XBOW, costs 2 flags on white-box XBOW, and is a batch-1 no-op on npm-bench. A static feature-flag system applied at the scan level can't optimize all three simultaneously. This is the direct motivation for learned dynamic routing — see [XSEC#113](https://github.com/uncesaii/xsec/issues/113).
2. **The attack agent baseline is strong without triage.** 86% on the first 50 XBOW white-box challenges with triage disabled, and 100% recall on npm-bench across profiles in this run.
3. **`egats` is the regressing layer in this isolation run.** Keep disabled by default and opt-in for research.
4. **npm-bench FPR attribution needs repeat runs.** Batch-1 results pointed at stable features; batch-2 reruns showed high variance at this sample size.
5. **Per-layer telemetry is now on.** Every finding produced after 2026-04-11 carries a `layerVerdicts` array that logs which layer touched it and what it did. That's the supervision signal for the learned-routing model in [XSEC#113](https://github.com/uncesaii/xsec/issues/113). See [XSEC#112](https://github.com/uncesaii/xsec/issues/112) for the instrumentation commit.

## Data foundation

Before the live runtime layers even matter, XSEC now has a reproducible
training-data pipeline:

- [Triage Dataset](/research/triage-dataset/) — JSONL generation from XBOW,
  npm-bench, and verified local scans
- [Feature Extractor](/research/feature-extractor/) — the 45 handcrafted
  features carried in every row

That gives a 12-part architecture summary:

1. dataset pipeline
2. 11 shipped runtime triage layers

This matters because the moat is not only the online verification stack.
It is also the offline ability to build, label, ablate, and retrain with
fully auditable data.

Each layer rejects or downgrades a fraction of the false positives that survived the previous layer. The numbers below are published figures for the reference technique — not a promise for any particular XSEC scan — but they show the shape of the stack.

| # | Layer | Module | Reference signal | Acts on |
|---|-------|--------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| 0 | Raw agent findings | `agentic-scanner.ts` | baseline (~50% FP on noisy targets) | — |
| 1 | Holding-it-wrong filter | `triage/holding-it-wrong.ts` | Removes library-API-as-vuln category entirely | Sink name |
| 2 | Feature extractor (45 features) | `triage/feature-extractor.ts` | 15.9% FPR alone (VulnBERT ablation) | Finding fields |
| 3 | Reachability gate | `triage/reachability.ts` | Large (Endor Labs' ~95% headline depends on this) | Source tree |
| 4 | Per-class oracles | `triage/oracles.ts` | Exploitable-only acceptance | Live target |
| 5 | Multi-modal (foxguard) | `triage/multi-modal.ts` | Mirrors Endor Labs' rules+neural agreement (~95% class) | Source tree |
| 6 | Structured 4-step verify | `triage/verify-pipeline.ts` | GitHub Security Lab reference (~30 real vulns surfaced from noise) | Finding + target |
| 7 | Consensus (self-consistency) | `verify-pipeline.ts` `runSelfConsistencyVerify` | Self-consistency voting converts single-run variance into stable majority | Finding + target |
| 8 | PoV gate | `triage/pov-gate.ts` | "Fuzzing Brain" empirical: no PoC = almost always FP | Live target |
| 9 | Triage memories | `triage/memories.ts` | Semgrep Assistant ~96% auto-triage (with user feedback) | Historical triage |
| 10 | Adversarial debate | `triage/adversarial.ts` | Anthropic debate reference | Finding + target |

**Historical target statement (pre-ablation):** drive raw false positives toward single-digit FPR while retaining high recall.

> **Measured effect (see "Measured results" above):** the full moat stack reduces findings substantially on XBOW, with slice-dependent recall/cost tradeoffs. Public SAST reference numbers are directional context, but are not directly comparable to agent-generated web exploitation findings.

### Why the stack ordering matters

Layers 1-3 are free (no LLM cost). Anything rejected here saves LLM spend on the later layers.

- **Layer 1 (holding-it-wrong)** is pure blocklist — microsecond cost, ~100% precision when it fires.
- **Layer 2 (features)** is regex and string ops — sub-millisecond, provides a fast prior for later layers.
- **Layer 3 (reachability)** is grep over the source tree — milliseconds, kills findings in dead code.

Layers 4-5 require either a live target (oracles) or a local tool (foxguard) but no LLM spend.

- **Layer 4 (oracles)** attempts the exploit deterministically. Verified = accept with zero LLM cost.
- **Layer 5 (multi-modal)** is a second, fully independent scanner. Agreement doubles the confidence; disagreement flags review.

Layers 6-10 spend LLM tokens, but only on findings that survived the free layers.

- **Layer 6 (structured verify)** is a 4-step decomposition with category-specific addendums — the GitHub Security Lab reference architecture.
- **Layer 7 (consensus)** converts single-shot variance into a stable majority vote, with early termination once a verdict can't be overturned.
- **Layer 8 (PoV gate)** enforces "no executable exploit = no finding" — the hardest filter in the stack.
- **Layer 9 (memories)** recycles prior human triage decisions so known FP patterns auto-reject without any verify cost.
- **Layer 10 (debate)** is the final tie-breaker, reserved for cases the rest of the stack couldn't resolve.

## Why this is auditable

Every part of the moat is inspectable:

- the dataset collector is in `packages/benchmark/src/triage-data-collector.ts`
- the feature layer is in `packages/core/src/triage/feature-extractor.ts`
- the runtime layers live under `packages/core/src/triage/`
- the stack has dedicated tests
- the LLM-backed layers are independently toggleable with `XSEC_FEATURE_*`
  flags

This is materially different from commercial systems where the reachability
engine, feedback store, or model pipeline is invisible.

## Our implementation notes

### Every layer ships as a feature flag

See `packages/core/src/agent/features.ts`. Flags:

- `XSEC_FEATURE_REACHABILITY_GATE`
- `XSEC_FEATURE_MULTIMODAL`
- `XSEC_FEATURE_POV_GATE`
- `XSEC_FEATURE_CONSENSUS_VERIFY`
- `XSEC_FEATURE_TRIAGE_MEMORIES`
- `XSEC_FEATURE_DEBATE`

This lets us A/B test each layer independently in CI against the XBOW benchmark and measure its marginal FP reduction.

### Dataset pipeline

The moat now has an offline data-generation surface in addition to the live
runtime filters. The collector can emit labeled rows from:

- benchmark flag extraction
- npm-bench package verdicts
- blind-verify statuses in the local SQLite DB

See [Triage Dataset](/research/triage-dataset/) for the JSONL schema and
[issue #67](https://github.com/uncesaii/xsec/issues/67) for the
paper-plan that uses it.

### Conservative by default

Every layer errs toward **keeping** findings when it's not confident. Reachability returns `reachable: true` with low confidence when its grep-based first pass can't reach a verdict. Memories only auto-reject on strong matches above a tunable score threshold. Consensus defaults ties to `rejected` but the caller can opt out. The stack is designed so each layer adds precision without costing recall on the next.

### foxguard × XSEC cross-validation

A second scanner (`foxguard`) can be used for independent cross-validation. This provides a rules-based signal alongside XSEC's agentic signal and supports disagreement-based triage workflows.

### Zero proprietary dependencies

- Reachability gate is grep/pattern-based — no LSP server, no compiled call graph, no Code API license.
- Feature extractor is regex — no embedding model, no GPU.
- Oracles use `fetch` and `createServer` — no external exploit framework.
- Multi-modal runs foxguard via `execFile` — no vendor API.
- Memories use the existing SQLite store — no vector DB.

Everything here can run on a developer laptop, in CI, or in an air-gapped environment.
