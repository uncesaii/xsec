# xsec — pre-built distribution image
#
# Multi-stage build:
#   stage 1 (builder): node:20 + pnpm, builds the bundled CLI in /app/dist
#   stage 2 (runtime): ubuntu:24.04 + Node 20 + pentest tooling + Playwright
#
# Usage:
#   docker run --rm -e AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=$KEY \
#     ghcr.io/uncesaii/xsec:latest scan --target https://example.com --scope /work/scope.json
# Build args:
#   INSTALL_SECLISTS=1     include SecLists wordlists (~1GB extra, off by default)
#   AZUREHOUND_VERSION=vX  pin the AzureHound release (checksum-verified, see below)

# Base system + Node 20 + pentest tooling.
# `ripgrep` is included because the audit/scan agent's discovery loop
# defaults to `rg` for fast source-tree searches across npm/cargo/oci
# packages — without it, every audit run logs `spawnSync rg ENOENT`
# and the agent falls back to slower `find` + per-file reads, hurting
# scan quality. Cheap to add (a few MB) and the agent has been
# expecting it since the audit subcommand shipped.

# Impacket + Certipy + the BloodHound CE collector come from PyPI, not apt.
#
# ubuntu:24.04 marks the system interpreter EXTERNALLY-MANAGED (PEP 668), so a
# bare `pip install` aborts. The two escapes are `--break-system-packages` and a
# venv; this uses a venv. `--break-system-packages` would let these packages'
# deep, tightly-pinned dependency trees (certipy-ad pins cryptography and
# impacket to exact minor ranges) overwrite the apt-managed python3-requests /
# python3-bs4 that the agent's own helper scripts import — a silent way to break
# unrelated scanning.
#
# The venv is deliberately NOT added to PATH: its bin/ contains a `python3` that
# would shadow the system interpreter and hide those same apt-installed modules.
# The console scripts are symlinked into /usr/local/bin instead — their shebangs
# hardcode the venv interpreter's absolute path, so they resolve correctly when
# invoked through the symlink.
#
# Impacket declares its examples via setuptools `scripts=`, so they install
# under their original filenames (secretsdump.py, GetUserSPNs.py, GetNPUsers.py,
# psexec.py, wmiexec.py, ntlmrelayx.py, ...) — hence the *.py symlink loop.
# bloodhound-ce is the CE-format collector whose JSON the `adgraph` analyzer
# ingests; the legacy `bloodhound` package emits the old pre-CE schema.

# AzureHound — the Azure/Entra collector. It's a Go binary shipped as a GitHub
# release asset, so there's no apt/pip package to pin; instead the tag is pinned
# and the download is checked against a SHA-256 recorded here. These two digests
# are the vendor-published `.sha256` sidecars, independently reproduced by
# downloading and hashing both archives (2026-07-27) — not copied on trust. If
# SpecterOps ever replaces the assets behind the tag, this build fails loudly
# instead of silently shipping different code.
#
# Default-on (unlike INSTALL_SECLISTS) because it's ~13MB and verifiable; the
# opt-in pattern is reserved for heavy or unverifiable additions.
