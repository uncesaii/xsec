#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bun-compile.sh — produce a self-contained xsec binary via `bun build --compile`.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/bun-compile.sh                    # compile for the host platform
#   scripts/bun-compile.sh bun-linux-x64      # cross-compile for a specific target
#   scripts/bun-compile.sh bun-darwin-arm64 ./dist-bin/xsec-darwin-arm64
#
# Must be run from the repo root. Assumes pnpm install + pnpm -r build have
# already run (workspace packages need their dist/ directories so Bun can
# resolve @xsec/shared etc.).
#
# Externals are chosen to match the runtime pattern in the source:
#   - playwright / playwright-core / electron / chromium-bidi  — loaded via
#     try/catch dynamic import in racing.ts / oracles.ts / egats.ts. Safe to
#     skip at compile time; runtime gracefully degrades when absent.
#   - bun:ffi                                                  — only resolved
#     on Bun at runtime anyway; no compile-time resolver exists.
#   - sharp                                                    — optional peer
#     of opentui's @opentui/core; not exercised by xsec code paths.
#   - node-sqlite3-wasm                                        — belt-and-
#     suspenders pairing with the lazy `createRequire` in wasm-shim.ts. The
#     Bun runtime always uses bun:sqlite via createBunEngine; the WASM
#     branch is dead code in the compiled binary. Marking it external
#     prevents Bun from baking node-sqlite3-wasm.wasm (and its absolute
#     `__dirname` path) into the binary, which is what crashed v0.10.1
#     with `ENOENT … node-sqlite3-wasm.wasm` on user machines.
