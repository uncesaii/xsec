/**
 * bundle-skills-assets.test.mjs — guards that the JIT methodology skill YAML
 * actually ships in the packaged CLI bundle.
 *
 * The skill loader (packages/core/src/agent/skills/index.ts) walks its own
 * module directory for *.yaml and validates each file as a skill. esbuild lands
 * that loader in dist/chunks/, so scripts/bundle-cli.mjs copies the skill tree
 * to dist/chunks/agent/skills/. Without that copy the shipped binary loads ZERO
 * skills — list_skills is empty even with XSEC_FEATURE_JIT_SKILLS on. This test
 * fails loudly if a build regresses that copy.
 *
 * Skips when no bundle is present (bundle build hasn't run), like install.test.
 *
 * Run with: pnpm test:bundle-skills  (root package.json)
