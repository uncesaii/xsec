/**
 * Docs must not point at code that does not exist.
 *
 * Motivation: an audit found `packages/core/src/triage/adversarial.ts` and
 * `packages/core/src/agent/loop-dispatch.ts` referenced across seven doc pages —
 * one of them marking the feature "Shipped" in a competitive comparison — when
 * neither file, nor its documented feature flag, existed anywhere in the tree.
 * For a project whose pitch is evidence-first honesty, docs claiming
 * capabilities we do not have is the worst possible bug class.
 *
 * This test parses every backticked `packages/...` and `xverse/...` source path
 * out of the docs and asserts it resolves on disk. Documenting something
 * unbuilt is still fine — describe it in prose, or mark it planned, but do not
 * hand the reader a file path that goes nowhere.
