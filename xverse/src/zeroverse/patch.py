"""Stage 9 — the patch loop (M7 #45/#46): the AIxCC "second half".

xverse's spine stops at a confirmed PoV (``pov.reproduced == True``). This stage
adds the scored half AIxCC measured — *propose a fix that closes the PoV without
breaking functionality* — and keeps PoV-is-truth's sibling discipline: a patch is
``verified`` ONLY when the confirmed PoV no longer reproduces against the patched
artifact AND no regression is observed (``oracle.verify_patch``, the deterministic
LLM-free adjudicator). It is gated on ``ZEROVERSE_PATCH=1`` and iterates ONLY over
findings that already carry a reproducing PoV.

Three layers, ordered by maturity (docs/… patching-design §4):

  * **B0 — located fix RECOMMENDATION** (always-on, zero-dep, deterministic): the
    sink symbol + ``sink_addr`` + function + decompiled-C snippet + a
    bug-class→fix-template. A *recommendation*, never a verified patch.
  * **Mode A — source patch** (opt-in ``PatchContext``): RCA from data xverse
    already has → an LLM unified diff (the provider-neutral ``LLM`` protocol +
    ``MockLLM``) → rebuild → ``verify_patch`` → reflect. It is an independent
    implementation of public methodology, capped at three iterations.
  * **B1 — binary micro-patch** (flag-gated, x86-64 ELF): a self-contained
    immediate-clamp guard works today; the SCRIBE recompile-trampoline and
    e9patch/Patcherex2 guard-insertion engines are scaffolded with backend
    detection and **degrade honestly to B0** when their tooling is absent. Always
    verified by re-running the PoV against the patched binary.
